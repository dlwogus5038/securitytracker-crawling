If the communications protocol sends a fixed plaintext portion (e.g., a secure cookie) repeatedly and also sends some amount of known plaintext, the user can recover the secret plaintext.\n\n[Editor's note: The report confirms a successful attack to recover secure HTTP cookies by capturing 785 GB of network traffic.]\n\nThe attack method is known as a SWEET32 attack.\n\n64-bit block ciphers, such as 3DES and Blowfish, are affected by this type of attack.\n\nThe original advisory will be presented at the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security and is available at:\n\nhttps://sweet32.info/SWEET32_CCS16.pdf\n\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent from INRIA reported this vulnerability.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in OpenSSL. A remote user can recover plaintext in certain cases.\nA remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against TLS or DTLS protected connections can recover the original plaintext when CBC-mode encryption is used.\n\nA user with low latency access to the target server's network can send specially crafted encrypted data and monitor the response timing to determine the plaintext contents of the data. For certain message lengths where the HMAC-SHA1 MAC algorithm is used, TLS messages containing at least two bytes of correct padding will be processed slightly faster than TLS messages containing one byte of correct padding or padding that is incorrectly formatted. By analyzing the timing variations over a large number of connections, the original plaintext can be determined.\n\nThis attack is known as the 'Lucky Thirteen' attack.\n\nThe vulnerability resides in the TLS/DTLS protocol specification rather than in the specific OpenSSL implementation. Many other implementations are affected.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/\n\nNadhem J. AlFardan and Kenneth G.

A remote user can modify packets, replay packets, and learn the pattern of the plain text.\nIt is reported that tinc does not provide packet authentication.  As a result, a remote user with access to the packet stream (i.e., somewhere along the transmission path) can modify the packet stream and choose the resulting plain text.\n\nA remote user can cut encrypted data from one part of a packet and paste the data into another location.  Because both data sections have been encrypted using the CBC encryption mode and using the same key, the plain text data will not appear to be random.  If the user has some idea of what the plain text data might be, the user may be able to modify the encrypted packet such that the decrypted plain text will appear to be valid.\n\nIt is reported that the initialization vector (IV) used by tinc are random and, therefore, are not guaranteed to be unique.  An IV should never be repeated for a given key.  Because the IV used in tinc is 16 bits in length and given typical packet sizes, if tinc forwards approximately 255 packets, it is reported that there is a 50% probability that at least 2 packets will have the same IV (this is known as the birthday problem).  If an IV is repeated, this allows a remote user with access to the tunnel packets to potentially determine the key stream for a given key, which allows the user to determine the plain text.\n\nIt is reported that tinc does not provide any packet replay protection.  As a result, a remote user with access to the encrypted packets can capture the packets and replay them later and the destination will consider them as legitimate and decrypt them.\n\nFor example, a remote user can replay a TCP SYN packet to perform a SYN flood attack on a server behind the tinc peer entity.\n\n[Editor's note:  The vendor's apparent web site (http://tinc.nl.linux.org/) could not be located at the time of this entry.

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in Check Point FireWall-1's SecuRemote VPN software.  A remote user can determine if a username is valid or not.\nIt is reported that when a remote user attempts to authenticate via the VPN-1 SecuRemote Authentication dialog box, a failed login response will indirectly indicate whether the username is incorrect or the password is incorrect, as the responses are different.\n\nIt is reported that if the username is valid and the password is incorrect, SecuRemote will return a dialog box with the message \"Access denied by FireWall-1 authentication\".  If the username is invalid, SecuRemote will apparently return a dialog box with the message \"User <unknown_user> not found\".\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

The flaw allows local users to modify certain VPN configuration information.\nIt is reported that Soft-PK stores policies that are specified as 'lockable' in plaintext.  The file can be edited and reloaded by a local user.  The software will still indicate that \"This Policy Is Locked\".\n\nExample policy contents are shown below:\n\n\"IPADDR\" =dword:0a810a01\n\"PORTNAME\"=\"SQL\"\n\"PORT\"=dword:00000599\n\nThis apparently maps an SQL Port (1433) to box 10.129.10.1\n\n\"IPADDR\" =dword:0a810a01\n\"PORTNAME\"=\"DEMO\"\n\"PORT\"=dword:00000017\n\nThis apparently maps to port 23 on the same box.\n\nThis vulnerability reportedly does not allow a local user to obtain the VPN keys or to initiate unauthorized VPN connections.",
