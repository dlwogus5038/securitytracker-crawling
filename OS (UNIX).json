Apple macOS/OS X is affected.\nOn systems where the the server is configured to proxy HTTP requests and the target CGI application relies on the HTTP_PROXY environment variable in a trusted manner, a remote user can send (or can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to insert or modify) a specially crafted HTTP \"Proxy:\" header to cause the target CGI application to proxy HTTP connections to an arbitrary port on an arbitrary server [CVE-2016-4694].

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in Apple OS X. A remote user can gain elevated privileges on the target user's system in certain cases.\nA remote user can create an application that, when installed by the target user, will access the keychain entry of a target application, delete the keychain entry, and then create a new, specially crafted keychain entry with the same attributes as the deleted entry. Then, when the target user subsequently updates their credentials for the target application, the remote user's application will gain access to the updated credentials from the new keychain entry.\n\nThe operating system does not provide authentication for WebSockets. A remote user can create an application that, when installed and loaded by the target user, will access an arbitrary WebSocket port and obtain potentially sensitive information from the target application using that port.\n\nA remote user can create an application package that contains a helper application with a specially crafted bundle ID of an existing target application. When the target user runs the (remote user's) application, the operating system will grant that application access to the target application's access control list (ACL) and, as a result, the target application's sandbox.\n\nThe vendor was notified on October 15, 2014.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/xaraflaws/\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.06836.pdf\n\nThe original advisory refers to this class of vulnerabilities as \"cross-app resource attacks\" (XARA).\n\n[Editor's note: The original advisory also reports that URL hijacking is possible, which is a vulnerability in specific applications that send sensitive data via URLs, rather than a vulnerability in the operating system.]\n\nLuyi Xing, Xiaolong Bai, XiaoFeng Wang, and Kai Chen of Indiana University Bloomington, Shi-Min Hu of Tsinghua University, Xiaojing Liao of Georgia Institute of Technology, and Xinhui Han and Tongxin Li of Peking University reported this vulnerability.",

A remote user can conduct cross-domain scripting attacks.\nA remote user can create specially crafted HTML that, when loaded by the target user, will trigger an invalid conversion in the WebKit code when rendering frame sets and execute arbitrary code on the target system [CVE-2007-2399].  The code will run with the privileges of the target user.\n\nApple credits Rhys Kidd of Westnet with reporting this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can create specially crafted HTML that, when loaded by the target user, will inject HTTP code via XMLHttpRequest and cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser [CVE-2007-2401].  The code will run in the security context of an arbitrary site.  As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nApple credits Richard Moore of Westpoint Ltd. with reporting this vulnerability.",

Apple credits Andrew Garber of University of Victoria, Alex Harper, and Michael Evans with reporting this vulnerability.\n\nApple indicates that a fix for this HID vulnerability was including in the Mac OS X v10.4.9 update but was not delivered to all systems. \n\nThe CoreServices daemon allows a local user to send interprocess communications to its Mach task port [CVE-2007-0732].  This may allow a local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  Systems prior to Mac OS X v10.4 are not affected.\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted UFS disk image that, when processed by fsck, will trigger a memory corruption error and potentially execute arbitrary code [CVE-2007-0734].\n\nLibinfo may not properly report errors to applications that use libinfo [CVE-2007-0735].  A remote user can create specially crafted HTML that, when loaded by the target user, will cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target user's system.  Apple credits Landon Fuller of Three Rings Design with reporting this vulnerability.\n\nIf the portmap service is enabled, a remote user can trigger an integer overflow in the RPC library [CVE-2007-0736].  Apple credits the Mu Security Research Team with reporting this vulnerability.\n\nIf Internet Sharing is enabled, a remote user can send specially crafted RTSP packets to trigger a buffer overflow in 'natd' [CVE-2007-0741].\n\nWebFoundation allows a cookie set by a subdomain to be accessed by the parent domain [CVE-2007-0742].

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the FreeBSD kernel in the checking of signal number values.  A local user may be able to trigger a kernel panic.  In some configurations, a local user may be able to modify kernel memory and take full control of the system.\nIt is reported that a local user can cause certain applications to send a negative or out-of-range signal number to the kernel. Those applications reportedly include the ptrace(2) system call and the 'spigot' video capture device driver.\n\nThe flaw in ptrace(2) was reportedly introduced into FreeBSD version 4.2.  The vulnerable `spigot' device driver was reportedly introduced in FreeBSD 2.0.5, but is not part of the default kernel (only systems with 'device spigot' in the kernel configuration are affected).\n\nAccording to the report, a local user can trigger an assertion failure and kernel panic.\n\nOn some FreeBSD 5.x systems (those where the 'INVARIANTS' kernel option is not used; including the default configuration of FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE and 5.1-RELEASE), the assertion code is not included.  As a result, a local user may be able to modify kernel memory.",

A local user can reportedly supply a large length parameter to gain read access to additional kernel memory.  Information disclosed may include passwords that allow the local user to gain elevated privileges.\n\nAccording to the report, the vulnerable module only loads if the 'option IBCS2' statement is set in the kernel configuration file, if kldload(8) is used to dynamically load it, or if 'ibcs2_enable' is set in the rc.conf(5) file.\n\nThe vendor credits David Rhodus <drhodus@catpa.com> with reporting this flaw.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the FreeBSD kernel in the checking of signal number values.  A local user may be able to trigger a kernel panic.  In some configurations, a local user may be able to modify kernel memory and take full control of the system.\nIt is reported that a local user can cause certain applications to send a negative or out-of-range signal number to the kernel. Those applications reportedly include the ptrace(2) system call and the 'spigot' video capture device driver.\n\nThe flaw in ptrace(2) was reportedly introduced into FreeBSD version 4.2.  The vulnerable `spigot' device driver was reportedly introduced in FreeBSD 2.0.5, but is not part of the default kernel (only systems with 'device spigot' in the kernel configuration are affected).\n\nAccording to the report, a local user can trigger an assertion failure and kernel panic.\n\nOn some FreeBSD 5.x systems (those where the 'INVARIANTS' kernel option is not used; including the default configuration of FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE and 5.1-RELEASE), the assertion code is not included.  As a result, a local user may be able to modify kernel memory.",

HP reports that Tru64 UNIX is affected.\nIt is reported that a kernel flaw in the allocating of file descriptors may allow a local user to obtain elevated privileges by exploiting a set user id (suid) or set group id (sgid) application.\n\nA local user can run a program that calls a set user id (suid) application, causing file descriptors to be duplicated using the dup() function, and then closes one or more of the stdio descriptors to set up the exploit.  Then, the local user can reportedly call a suid root application that opens a root-owned file (e.g., the passwd file).  The local user can apparently invoke an error, causing the suid program to write user-supplied data to stderr.  This may cause the arbitrary user-supplied text to be written to the root-owned file.\n\nIt is reported that this vulnerability has been confirmed with an exploit that uses the S/KEY binaries to allow a local user to obtain root privileges on the system.",

A local user could trigger a kernel panic, gain elevated privileges, or view files on the system.\nPine Digital Security reported that there is an exploitable integer overflow in the FreeBSD operating system kernel. \t\nIt is reported that the fpathconf(2) system call is missing a call to the fdrop() function.  When an fpathconf(2) call is issued on a socket, the call will reportedly issue an fhold() call to prevent the associated file from being closed during the operation.  However, the fpathconf(2) call may return an error indication in some situations without issuing an fdrop() call to release the extra file reference.\n\nBecause of this, a local user could cause the 'f_count' integer reference counter of the specified file structure to overflow.  When the original file descriptor is closed, the associated file structure will be deallocated.  This leaves the extra file reference remaining with a file structure that points to unallocated memory.\n\nThe same type of flaw reportedly exists in the lseek(2) system call in some versions of FreeBSD.\n\nPine Digital Security notes that the missing fdrop() call in fpathconf(2) was previously reported by Nakamura Takayuki, but that the impact was originally underestimated.",

Other BSD-based systems may also be affected.\nIt is reported that a kernel flaw in the allocating of file descriptors may allow a local user to obtain elevated privileges by exploiting a set user id (suid) or set group id (sgid) application.\n\nA local user can run a program that calls a set user id (suid) application, causing file descriptors to be duplicated using the dup() function, and then closes one or more of the stdio descriptors to set up the exploit.  Then, the local user can reportedly call a suid root application that opens a root-owned file (e.g., the passwd file).  The local user can apparently invoke an error, causing the suid program to write user-supplied data to stderr.  This may cause the arbitrary user-supplied text to be written to the root-owned file.\n\nIt is reported that this vulnerability has been confirmed with an exploit that uses the S/KEY binaries to allow a local user to obtain root privileges on the system.",

A local user can cause a system panic.\nIt is reported that a local user can call the TIOCSCTTY ioctl repeatedly to cause a kernel structure counter to overflow and prematurely free memory.  This could cause a kernel panic or incorrect operating system operation.\n\nA counter used to track the number of times a particular shared structure is accessed could be made to overflow.  Then, when a process exits and the session structure counter is decreased, the counter will reach zero causing the kernel to free the structure, even though there may be processes that still reference the structure.  As a result, the freeded memory may be overwritten with 'junk data' or random data.

A remote user can execute arbitrary code to gain root level access to the system.\nIt is reported that the vulnerability exists in rwall_subr.c, where a user-supplied message is passed to a syslog() call without proper formatting.  The code is apparently triggered only when a popen(WALL_PROG, \"w\") call fails.  If the remote user can cause this call to fail, then the remote user can execute arbitrary code.  \n\nAccording to the report, the popen() call can be made to fail under certain conditions, such as if there are no available file descriptors.  A remote user may be able to trigger this condition by rapidly consuming file descriptors (possibly by making a large number of tcp connections to the target host, each of which apparently consumes a file descriptor).\n\nIt is reported that this flaw is more readily exploitable when local access is available.\n\nA demonstration exploit is included in the Source Message.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in the QNX operating system.  A local user can gain root access on the system.\nIt is reported that some components of the operating system that are configured with set user id (suid) privileges fail to check permissions of pre-existing target files when writing to those target files.  In addition, the system will follow hard links.  Apparently, the system will also give the calling user ownership of the overwritten file.\n\nOne vulnerabile program is /bin/dumper.  A local user can create a hard link from a read-only, root-owned file (e.g., /etc/passwd) to another file on the system.  Then, the local user can call 'dumper' to cause the linked file to be overwritten, thereby overwriting the root-owned file and giving ownership of the root-owned file to the local user.\n\nA demonstration exploit transcript is provided:\n\n[EVIL is the unprivileged local user.]\n\n#link to the passwd file: dumper dumps to [process name].dmp\n$ ln /etc/passwd /home/EVIL/ksh.dmp\n#call the program that will attempt to write to the hard link\n$ dumper -d /home/EVIL -p [PID of EVIL's ksh]\n#have dumper do its job by terminating the monitored process\n$ exit\n#at this point, /etc/passwd is overwritten by the binary dump, and more importantly: EVIL is now the owner !\n$ echo root::0:0::///:/bin/sh > /etc/passwd\n\nThis yields a password file that is owned by the local user and has a null password for the root account.  Because the password file is no longer owned by root, login attempts will fail.  The local user can use the 'passwd' utility to change their password to cause the password file ownership to be reset to root, leaving the local user's modifications untouched.\n\nOther similar vulnerabilities exist in monitor and crttrap.  With crttrap, a local user can view the contents of root-owned files.  For example, a local user can view the shadow password file with the following command:\n\n$ crttrap -c /etc/shadow",

This feature is rarely used outside of AutoClient and is undocumented.\n\nThe \"disconnectable\" option is specified at mount time using the usual mount syntax and is not enabled by default.\n\nIf cachefsd is disabled and the file server becomes unavailable then file systems mounted as \"disconnectable\" will not be reconnected when the service returns. For this reason we recommend that the \"disconnectable\" option is not used while cachefsd is disabled.\n\nMounts and unmounts should still succeed though an error message may be seen, e.g.\n\nmount -F cachefs: cachefsd is not running\n\nThere is no performance impact.\n\n\n- for systems using AutoClient:\n\nIn addition to the advice given for systems using cachefs:\n\nOnly AutoClient systems using the \"disconnectable\" feature will be affected. Should the server become unavailable the root and /usr file systems will switch to disconnected mode as usual but will not be reconnected when the service returns. For this reason we recommend that the \"disconnectable\" option is not used with AutoClient while cachefsd is disabled on the client.\n\nIf cachefsd is disabled a warning message will appear during the boot of the AutoClient system:\n\nWARNING: Timed out waiting for cachefs service to register\n\nThis indicates that the cachefsd service is not available which is as expected.\n\nThere is no performance impact.",

A remote user could open many connections to the system via a socket that applies accept filtering to deny service to the system.\nThe accept_filter(9) mechanism allows an application to ask the kernel to pre-process incoming connections.  This is not a default mechanism -- it requires that a system administrator compile the option into the kernel or dynamically load it.\n\nA remote or local user could connect to a socket that is configured for accept filtering and, by repeatedly doing this and keeping a few hundred sockets open (~190 with the default backlog value), create a denial of service condition.\n\nAccording to FreeBSD, Apache (versions 1.3.14 and later) is the only application known to utilize accept filters by default.",

If you have enabled the ACCEPT_FILTER_DATA or ACCEPT_FILTER_HTTP options in your kernel, remove these options and recompile your kernel as described in <URL:http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the system.  If you have loaded one of the kernel accept filters by using kldload(8), then you must modify your startup scripts not to load these modules and reboot your system.  You may list loaded kernel modules by using kldstat(8).  If loaded, the HTTP accept filter will be listed as `accf_http.ko', and the Data accept filter will be listed as `accf_data.ko'.\n\nFor affected versions of Apache, accept filters may be disabled either by adding the directive ``AcceptFilter off'' to your configuration file, or via a compile-time option, depending upon the version.

Sun has issued the following workaround while a final resolution is pending:\n\nComment out cachefsd in /etc/inetd.conf as shown below:\n\nFor Solaris 2.6, 7 and 8:\n\n#100235/1 tli rpc/tcp wait root /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd  cachefsd\n\nFor Solaris 2.5.1:\n\n#100235/1 stream rpc/tcp wait root /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd  cachefsd            \n\nOnce the line is commented out either:\n\n- reboot, or\n- send a HUP signal to inetd(1M) and kill existing cachefsd processes, for example,\n\t  on Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 do the following:\n\t\t$ kill -HUP <PID of inetd>\n\t\t$ kill <PIDs of any cachefsd processes>\n\n\t  Solaris 7 and 8 do the following:\n\t\t$ pkill -HUP inetd\n\t\t$ pkill cachefsd                              \n\nThe possible side effects of the workaround are:\n\n- for systems not using cachefs:\n\nThere is no impact.\n\n- for systems using cachefs:\n\nOnly the \"disconnectable\" mount option is known to be affected by disabling cachefsd. This feature is rarely used outside of AutoClient and is undocumented.\n\nThe \"disconnectable\" option is specified at mount time using the usual mount syntax and is not enabled by default.\n\nIf cachefsd is disabled and the file server becomes unavailable then file systems mounted as \"disconnectable\" will not be reconnected when the service returns. For this reason we recommend that the \"disconnectable\" option is not used while cachefsd is disabled.\n\nMounts and unmounts should still succeed though an error message may be seen, e.g.\n\n  mount -F cachefs: cachefsd is not running\n\nThere is no performance impact.\n\n\n- for systems using AutoClient:\n\nIn addition to the advice given for systems using cachefs:\n\nOnly AutoClient systems using the \"disconnectable\" feature will be affected. Should the server become unavailable the root and /usr file systems will switch to disconnected mode as usual but will not be reconnected when the service returns. For this reason we recommend that the \"disconnectable\" option is not used with AutoClient while cachefsd is disabled on the client.\n\nIf cachefsd is disabled a warning message will appear during the boot of the AutoClient system:\n\nWARNING: Timed out waiting for cachefs service to register\n\nThis indicates that the cachefsd service is not available which is as expected.\n\nThere is no performance impact.",

    "Description": "FreeBSD reported a denial of service error in the FreeBSD UNIX kernel.  A remote user may be able to cause the system to crash in a certain configuration.\nThere is reportedly a flaw in the implementation of the SYN cache (\"syncache\") and SYN cookie (\"syncookie\") mechanisms, features of the TCP/IP stack designed to improve resistance to SYN flood denial of service attacks.  A remote user may be able to send legitimate TCP/IP packets to cause the machine to crash.\n\nThe flaw is reportedly an implementation error with the SYN flood protection mechanism.  \n\nIn one case, the kernel may use an uninitialized pointer to locate the TCP options when a SYN packet is accepted via a syncookie.  If the pointer was a null pointer (which may occur), the kernel will crash.\n\nIn another case, if an application creates a listen socket and receives a SYN (resulting in a syncache entry) and then is killed and restarted (recreating the listen socket with a different inpcb), it is possible that a subsequent packet such as an ACK or a duplicate SYN could arrive and match the existing syncache entry.  Because the syncache would reference the old inpcb pointer, this may cause the system to crash depending on the pointer contents.\n\nThis vulnerability reportedly only affects FreeBSD.\n\nFreeBSD credits Alan Judge <Alan.Judge@eircom.net> and Dima Ruban <dima@FreeBSD.org>.",

    "Description": "The Dublin City University Networking Society (RedBrick) reported a vulnerability in pt_chmod.  The utility does not recognize access control lists and allows local users to obtain write access on relinquished ttys as they are allocated to other users.\nIt is reported that a local user can obtain full write access on all tty's previously allocated to another user when they are reallocated. A local user can ammend the access control list (ACL) on a tty that they own such that when the tty is later allocated to another user, the original user retains write access.  This allows a local user to send bogus output to another user's tty.\n\nIt is reported that read/execute permissions are not retained.\n\nThe author of the report notes that this issue has been previously discussed on the comp.unix.solaris and comp.unix.security newsgroups.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

Perform one of the following steps:\n\n1) Upgrade your vulnerable FreeBSD system to 4.4-STABLE, or the RELENG_4_3 or RELENG_4_4 security branch, dated after the respective correction date.\n\n2) To patch your present system:\n\na) Download the relevant patch from the following location:\n\n[FreeBSD 4.4-STABLE, or RELENG_4_3 and RELENG_4_4 security branches]\n\nftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:08/exec.patch\nftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:08/exec.patch.asc\n\n[FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE only]\n\nftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:08/exec-43R.patch\nftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:08/exec-43R.patch.asc\n\nb) Verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.\n\nc) Execute the following commands as root:\n\n# cd /usr/src\n# patch -p < /path/to/patch\n\nRecompile your kernel as described in\nhttp://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html\nand reboot the system.\n\n3) FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE systems:\n\nAn experimental upgrade package is available for users who wish to provide testing and feedback on the binary upgrade process.  This package may be installed on FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE systems only, and is intended for use on systems for which source patching is not practical or convenient.\n\nIf you use the upgrade package, feedback (positive or negative) to security-officer@FreeBSD.org is requested so we can improve the process for future advisories.\n\nSince this vulnerability involves the FreeBSD kernel which is often locally customized on installed systems, a universal binary upgrade package is not feasible.  This package includes a patched version of the GENERIC kernel which should be suitable for use on many systems.  Systems requiring a customized kernel must use an alternative solution.\n\nDuring the installation procedure, backup copies are made of the files which are replaced by the package.  These backup copies will be reinstalled if the package is removed, reverting the system to a pre-patched state.\n\n# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/packages/SA-02:08/security-patch-exec-02.08.tgz\n# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/packages/SA-02:08/security-patch-exec-02.08.tgz.asc\n\nVerify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.\n\n# pkg_add security-patch-exec-02.08.tgz\n\nThe new kernel is named /kernel.GENERIC to avoid conflict with the default kernel name (``/kernel'').  To cause the system to boot automatically with the new kernel, add the following line to /boot/loader.conf:\n\nkernel=\"/kernel.GENERIC\"\n\nand reboot the system to load the new kernel.  The old kernel is still available and can be manually loaded in the boot loader in case of problems.",

If a local user passes a large 'nsops' value (>INT_MAX) via the sempo(2) call, the kernel function sys_semop() will not check for an oversized value (negative value), allowing data from user memory space to be written to the process's kernel stack.\n\nmount args - If user mounts are enabled, any local user can exploit this to deny service.  User mounts are disabled by default on NetBSD 1.5 and later.  It is reported that NFS does not check the nfs file handle size and the size of some other strings, allowing a local user to cause a kernel panic.\n\nsome device ioctls - Any local user with write access to the appropriate device files can exploit this.  Note that, by default, only root has write access on most device files.  Some device drivers (listed in the Source Message) performed checking  in their ioctl(9) routines, allowing a local user to cause a kernel panic.  In addition, the lfs_markv(2) system call (which is restricted to root users) does not check the blkcnt argument, allowing a local root-level user to cause a kernel panic.",

It runs with the set group id (setgid) 'kmem' group privilege to allow direct kernel memory access.  The procfs code checks for gid kmem privilege when granting access to the /proc/<pid>/mem file.  However, there is a flaw in the access control code.  Instead of granting read-only access to kmem group members, the process grants read-only access to the caller as long as the caller has an open file descriptor for the procfs mem file.\n\nAs a result, if a process initially has debugging rights to a second process, it may retain access to the target process' memory space, even if the target process has obtained elevated privileges via an execve() call on a set user id (setuid) or setgid process.  Sensitive information from such processes could be leaked to the caller.\n\nThe vendor reports that this vulnerability may only be exploited on processes that initially are \"debuggable\" by the attacking process.  Because of this, any attack is reportedly limited to executed processes which gain privilege via setuid or setgid and cannot be targeted against other processes which are already running with a particular privileges.\n\nIt is reported that the linprocfs filesystem is also vulnerable if procfs support is available in the kernel.\n\nAll released versions of FreeBSD 4.x including FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE if procfs filesystem is in use.",

    "Description": "Georgi Guninski reported a signal handler vulnerability in the FreeBSD kernel that may allow local users to obtain root level privileges.\nIt is reported that a flaw exists in FreeBSD signal handler clearing that may allow some signal handlers to remain in effect after an exec() call.  This allows a local user to execute arbitrary code with set user id (setuid) root privileges.\n\nWhen a process forks using rfork(), the child process inherits the parent's signals.  When the child process performs an exec() function, the kernel clears the signal handlers because they are not valid in the new address space.  The vulnerability is due to rfork(RFPROC|RFSIGSHARE), which shares the signal handlers between parent and child processes.  If the child process performs an exec() on a setuid program and then the parent process subsequently sets a signal handler, the signal handler is replicated in the child process.  The address of the signal handler may therefore be available in the environment, so sending a signal to the child process may result in the shared signal handler being executed by the child process.",

The security hole allows local users to elevate their privileges, possibly gaining root level privileges on the server.  The Sparc versions are not affected.\nSun provides no details, but indicates that a local user can supply carefully constructed arguments to a syscall to obtain higher privilege than authorized.  This could reportedly be used to control arbitrary addresses in kernel memory (which, presumably, could allow root-level access).\n\nThe Intel i386 architecture supports a hardware-based protection and segmentation model which allows different levels of privilege.  The vulnerability relates to this functionality.\n\nSun notes that the Intel Platform Editions of Trusted Solaris 8 and 7 are also vulnerable.\n\nSun reports that all SPARC Platform Editions of Solaris are not vulnerable and any Intel Platform Editions of Solaris prior to 2.6 are also not vulnerable.",
