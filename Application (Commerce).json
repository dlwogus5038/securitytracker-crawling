A remote authenticated can determine the installation path and directory structure and can run arbitrary reports in certain cases.  A user can also bypass password policy.\nPortcullis reported that several internal variables contained within HTML web pages on the application disclose the installation path to remote authenticated users.\n\nA remote authenticated user can modify variables provided to 'BTInteractiveViewer.asp' during report selection to determine part of the directory structure on the target system.  If the user-supplied 'ReportName' contains a filename that exists in the user-supplied 'ReportPath' filepath, the system will indicate:\n\nUnable to load report\n\nIf the filename does not exist in that filepath, the system will indicate:\n\nThe system cannot find the file specified\n\nIf the filepath (directory) does not exist, the system will indicate:\n\nThe system cannot find the path specified\n\nIt is reported that the password policy (such as the minimum length of a password) is enforced via Javascript on the target user's system rather than on the server.  As a result, a user can set their password to a length that is not permitted by the policy (e.g., a single-character password).\n\nA remote authenticated user can modify their password without having to re-enter the original password.\n\nA remote authenticated user can modify certain parameters when selecting a report to cause the application to download and execute arbitrary reports from any system on the network that supports Windows shares.  It may be possible to execute a report that displays sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords.",

A local user can gain elevated privileges on the system.\nIt is reported that webc.cgi/webc.exe component contains buffer overflow, format string, and file handling vulnerabilities.\n\nA remote user can reportedly pass a long script name to webc.cgi to trigger a buffer overflow and cause arbitrary code to be executed:\n\nhttp://[target]/cgi-bin/webc.cgi/AAAAAAAAAAA ... ( ~ 550 A chars)\n\nIt is also reported that the software does not safely process certain configuration files.  A local user can create a symbolic link from a user-created file to the name of a webc.cgi configuration file in the current working directory.  The software will reportedly read the configuration file (symlinked to the user-created file) from the the current working directory.  If the configuration file enables process debugging, it is possible to trigger buffer overflows in the debugging section of the software and execute arbitrary code, according to the report.  A demonstration exploit is described in the Source Message.\n\nIt is also reported that the software contains various stack overflows that can be triggered by a local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  The report states that if WebC is installed with set user id (setuid) root privileges, it can change its effected UID to a user-specified value (but not to \"root\") as set in the PATH_INFO environment variable.  If debugging is enabled, the software will copy each environment variable onto the stack without performing bounds checking.  This allows the local user to cause arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of any non-root user on the system.  If WebC is installed with the privileges of a specific user (instead of setuid root), the arbitrary code will run with the privileges of that specific user.\n\nA local user may be able to obtain root group privileges in certain cases where webc.cgi has the set group id (setgid) bit set.\n\nFinally, a format string vulnerability was reported.  A local user can cause WebC to read a specially crafted 'webc.emf' file (used to store error messages) from the current working directory.  If the file contains lines with format characters, the local user can cause arbitrary code to be executed.\n\nA demonstration exploit example is provided:\n\n020052%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x. + 449 NULLs",

    "Description": "Microsoft reported several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Microsoft Commerce Server.  A remote user could execute arbitrary code on the system with LocalSystem privileges.\nFour separate vulnerabilities were reported.\n\nA buffer overflow in the Profile Service of Commerce Server 2000 in processing certain types of API calls may allow a remote authenticated user to supply specially crafted data to certain calls to cause the service to crash or to execute arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges.  This would give the remote user complete control over the system.  Note that the Profile Service is installed by default but is not enabled by default.  So, these calls are not exposed to the Internet by default.  Also, the remote user must be authenticated to the Commerce Server web site (or the site must allow self-registration).\n\nA buffer overflow in the Office Web Components (OWC) package installer component of Commerce Server 2000 may allow a remote authenticated user to supply specially crafted data as input to the OWC package installer to cause the process to crash or to execute arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges.\n\nAnother bug in the the Office Web Components (OWC) package installer used by Commerce Server 2000 could allow a remote authenticated user to invoke the OWC package installer in a particular manner to cause commands to be executed on the system with the same privileges as the user.\n\nA buffer overflow in the ISAPI AuthFilter code that processes certain types of authentication requests in Commerce Server 2000 and 2002 allows a remote user to execute arbitrary code on the system to take full control of the system.  This flaw is reportedly similar to the ISAPI filter buffer overrun vulnerability discussed in MS02-010.  However, Microsoft states that only Commerce Server users are affected and Internet Information Server (IIS) are not affected [the previous MS02-010 bug affected IIS].  The ISAPI filter is installed by default but is not loaded on any Commerce Server web site by default.  According to the report, it must be enabled through the Commerce Server Administration Console in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). \n\nThe vendor notes that Site Server 3.0 and Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition are not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.\n\nMicrosoft credits Mark Litchfield of Next Generation Security Software Ltd. for reporting the Profile Service and OWC package vulnerabilities.",

The administrative pages are protected by HTTP authentication, so the javascript can take any actions as the administrator without having to authenticate.\n\nAs a demonstration, enter the following name when registering as a new customer, then go to the administrative pages to view the customer list to cause a dialog box to pop-up:\n\nblackhat<script>alert('ouch')</script>",

The system discloses some critical information to remote users and the system enables cross-site scripting attacks.\nIt is reported that the /diagnose.cgi and /compatible.cgi scripts will disclose files in the web directory and information about the system to remote users.  \n\nA remote user can reportedly obtain the 'config.asc' file from the 'cownsconf' directory, which contains the encrypted admin password and the location of the web root directory and other critical directories (e.g., 'orders', 'custdata').  A remote user can apparently view *.asc files in the 'custdata' directory containing user information (e.g., e-mail address, name, postal address, phone number, password).  A remote user can apparently view information about previous orders (e.g., username, date, card type, card expiration data, price) in the 'orders' directory.\n\nThese scripts also reportedly allow a remote user to supply malicious scripts as part of a cross-site scripting attack.  The following type of URLs can be used to execute scripts on the viewing user's browser:\n\n/diagnose.cgi?<script>MALICIOUS SCRIPT</script>\n\n/compatible.cgi?<script>MALICIOUS SCRIPT</script>\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",
