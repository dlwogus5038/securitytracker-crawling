    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in OpenSSL. A remote user can decrypt TLS sessions in certain cases. A remote user can cause denial of service conditions on the target system. IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager is affected.\nA remote user can decrypt TLS sessions in certain cases by using a server that supports SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle [CVE-2016-0800]. This attack is known as a DROWN attack.\n\nSystems with a private key used on another server for any protocol that allows SSLv2 connections are affected.\n\nSystems running versions prior to 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r, and 0.9.8zf (released on March 19, 2015) can be exploited more readily.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttps://drownattack.com/drown-attack-paper.pdf\n\nNimrod Aviram, Sebastian Schinzel, Juraj Somorovsky, Nadia Heninger, Maik Dankel, Jens Steube, Luke Valenta, David Adrian, J. Alex Halderman, Viktor Dukhovni, Emilia Kasper, Shaanan Cohney, Susanne Engels, Christof Paar, and Yuval Shavitt reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted private DSA key that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a double free memory error and cause denial of service conditions [CVE-2016-0705].\n\nAdam Langley (Google/BoringSSL) reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can supply a specially crafted username value to the target SRP server to trigger a memory leak [CVE-2016-0798].\n\nEmilia Kasper of the OpenSSL development team reported this vulnerability.\n\nA user can create specially crafted data (e.g., configuration file) that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a null pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() functions [CVE-2016-0797].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.\n\nA user can create specially crafted data that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a memory error in BIO_*printf() functions [CVE-2016-0799].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.\n\nA local user can conduct a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture to potentially recover RSA keys [CVE-2016-0702].\n\nYuval Yarom, the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin, Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger, University of Pennsylvania, reported this vulnerability.\n\nThe SSLv2 's2_srvr.c' code does not ensure that a clear-key-length value is 0 for non-export ciphers. As a result, clear-key bytes can displace encrypted-key bytes, which can be exploited to conduct a key recovery attack [CVE-2016-0703].\n\nVersions 1.0.2, 1.0.1l, 1.0.0q, and 0.9.8ze and prior versions are affected.\n\nDavid Adrian and J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan reported this vulnerability.\n\nThe Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites in 's2_srvr.c' overwrites bytes incorrectly in the master-key, which may provide a Bleichenbacher oracle that can be used to decrypt sessions [CVE-2016-0704].\n\nVersions 1.0.2, 1.0.1l, 1.0.0q, and 0.9.8ze and all prior versions are affected.\n\nDavid Adrian and J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can trigger an out-of-bounds memory write error in doapr_outch() in 'crypto/bio/b_print.c' to potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system [CVE-2016-2842].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.",

A remote user can obtain potentially sensitive information, cause the target service to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code.\nRichard Stanway reported that the software fails to properly validate user-supplied input in several fields.\n\nThe server does not validate the offsets in Configstrings and Baselines to ensure non-negative values.  A remote user can specify a negative value to cause the service to crash.\n\nA buffer overflow exists in the processing of received packet arguments.  A remote user can supply a specially crafted argument to trigger the overflow.\n\nOn Windows-based servers, a remote user can exploit an input validation flaw in the download command to obtain some files from the system.  A demonstration exploit command to retrieve the 'server.cfg' file from the 'mod' directory is provided:\n\ndownload \\/server.cfg\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can specify a specially crafted path for the download command to cause the target service to crash when attempting to open the specified directory.  A demonstration exploit is provided:\n\ndownload  /maps/\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user may be able to avoid server bans by sending a specially crafted userinfo string ('ip' value) that is large enough to be truncated when processed by the target mod.\n\nA remote user can send an invalid disconnect command and then reconnect to cause the server to allocate a slot that is already in use by another client.  This will cause the client state data to be overwritten, which may adversely affect the server.\n\nIt is reported that some of the above listed flaws may affected the underlying Quake II engine, used by various 3rd party games including Anachronox, Daikatana, Heretic II, Kingpin: Life of Crime, Soldier of Fortune, and Sin.\n\nUsers of the QuakeSrc.org message boards are credited with reporting some of these flaws.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://secur1ty.net/advisories/001",

    "Description": "Several security vulnerabilities were reported in the NetUP UTM ISP billing system.  A remote user can inject SQL commands to hijack administrator sessions and then execute arbitrary shell commands.  A local user with certain privileges can obtain root privileges.\nIt is reported that a remote user can submit a specially crafted HTTP GET request to inject SQL commands to be executed by the underlying database.  The report indicates that the 'admin' and 'utm_stat' scripts do not properly validate the user-supplied 'sid' parameter.  A remote user can take actions on the system without supplying valid authentication credentials and can hijack existing sessions (including administrator sessions).  Some demonstration exploit URLs are provided:\n\nhttps://somehost/cgi-bin/utm/admin?cmd=full_view&sid=q%22%20OR%201=1%20OR%20%22q%22=%22q\nhttps://somehost/cgi-bin/utm/utm_stat?cmd=user_report&sid=q%22%20OR%201=1%20OR%20%22q%22=%22q\n\nIt is also reported that the '/cgi-bin/utm/user_stat' script does not escape user-supplied query parameters.  A remtoe authenticated user can inject SQL commands to modify their account details, including billing data.\n\nOther SQL injection flaws reportedly reside in the software.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote authenticated administrator (or a remote user that has hijacked an administrator session) can execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system.\n\nIf firewall rule setup is enabled (it is not, by default), an administrator can append a semicolon and arbitrary shell commands to a firewall rule, causing the shell commands to be executed with the privileges of the web server process.  If firewall rule setup is not enabled (the default configuration), the administrator can still execute shell commands using a more complicated exploit method.  The administrator can inject SQL commands via the '/cgi-bin/utm/admin' script to modify the 'dict' table, which can then override the 'netup/utm/utm.cfg' configuration file's sudo_path value.  When sudo is next executed, the overwritten sudo_path will be invoked and the administrator's arbitrary shell commands will be executed with the privileges of the web server process.\n\nIt is also reported that a local user with web server privileges (e.g., 'nobody') can obtain root privileges.  The system reportedly includes a sudo entry that permits the user to move files with root privileges:\n\nnobody  ALL= NOPASSWD: /bin/mv",

A remote user can consume all available player slots with phantom players, denying access to legitimate players.\nIt is reported that a remote user can connect to the server (default port is 27015) to interact with the server to create phantom (non-existent) users.  The remote user send a UDP datagram to the server with a challenge request of the following form:\n\n\"\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xffgetchallenge\\n\"\n\nThe server will respond with a challenge key value.  The client can complete the protocol handshake and send a bogus connection request of the form:\n\n\"connect %protocol %challenge_key %cd_key %player_info\"\n\nThe '%cd_key' can be filled with random characters.  This will result in a phantom player being created on the server.  \n\nThe remote user can repeat this process using a different '%cd_key' and a different UDP source address to create an unlimited number of phantom players.\n\nWhen the server reaches the maximum number of players, no additional players will be accepted.\n\nAccording to the report, a phantom player will be timed out after a certain period (the default is 60 seconds).  However, the remote user can initiate another challenge to return the server to a denial of service condition.\n\nApparently, the Half-Life server administrator will see that the maximum number of players has been reached, but no players will be named (as they are phantom players).\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

    "Description": "A temporary file symbolic link vulnerability was reported in the Maelstrom game.  A local user may be able to cause files to be overwritten on the system.\nIt is reported that Maelstrom uses a predictable temporary file name and does not check for existing symbolic links (symlinks) when creating the temporary file.  A local user can create a symlink from the temporary file name to another critical file on the system.  Then, when another user executes Maelstrom, the linked file will be overwritten with the privileges of the other user.",

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in a library included in the ClanLib game software development kit.  A remote user can execute arbitrary code on the system.  Some games that have set user id (suid) root privileges can be exploited by local users to yield root access.\nA local user can set the HOME environment variable to a long string and then invoke a game that uses ClanLib to execute arbitrary code on the host.  For example, the Super Methane Brothers game, which is apparently configured with set group id (sgid) 'games' group privileges, lets a local user execute code with 'games' group privileges and obtain elevated privileges on the host.\n\nA demonstration exploit transcript is provided:\n\n[root@linuxppc root]# export HOME=`perl -e 'print \"A\" x 9000'`\n[root@linuxppc root]# /usr/games/methane\nSuper Methane Brothers\nLicensed using the GNU General Public License Version 2\nhttp://www.methane.fsnet.co.uk\n...\nThis game requires ClanLib (v0.5.0) and Hermes (v1.3.3) \nhttp://clanlib.org/hermes\n(High Scores written to /var/lib/games/methanescores)\nSegmentation fault\n\nThe author of the report has provided demonstration exploit transcripts for a few other vulnerable games that use ClanLib (see the Source Message).",
