A remote user can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack on SSL session renegotiation.\nA remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack can exploit a flaw in the underlying SSL/TLS protocol to inject arbitrary plain text into the exchange between the client and the server, with the arbitrary data as a prefix to the session.\n\nThe vulnerability resides in the TLS 1.0 or later and SSLv3 protocols.\n\nCisco has assigned Cisco Bug IDs CSCtd05790 (Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise), CSCtd05790 (Cisco Unified Contact Center Express), CSCtd05755 (Cisco Unified Contact Center Management Portal), and CSCtd05790 (Cisco Unified Contact Center Products) to this vulnerability.\n\nMarsh Ray of PhoneFactor and Martin Rex independently reported this vulnerability.\n\n[Editor's note:  The flaw resides in the protocol and not in the protocol implementation.

A remote user can execute arbitrary code with System privileges on the target system.\nIt is reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted message to the Workstation service to cause the service to crash or execute arbitrary code with System level privileges.  Other attack vectors can reportedly be used.  For example, a remote authenticated user can login and send malformed messages to the service or an application that passes messages to the service can be exploited.\n\nThe flaw exists in the Wkssvc.dll file.\n\nThe Workstation service is used to route local file system requests and remote file or print network requests and is enabled by default, according to the report.\n\nMicrosoft indicates that if you have blocked inbound UDP ports 138, 139, 445 and TCP ports 138, 139, 445 with a firewall, a remote user cannot send messages to the Workstation service.\n\nMicrosoft credits eEye Digital Security with reporting this flaw.",

A remote user can send a specially crafted UDP packet to the target system on the data port (2074) or the control port (2075) to cause the 'sfspeaker' application to crash or execute arbitrary code.  \n\nThe vendor notes that a remote user can send a VAT protocol packet with a user name longer than 256 bytes and, if showhosts is set, the name edit buffer will overflow.  A potential buffer overflow regarding the use of \"face files\" was also reported.\n\nIt is also reported that the software uses temporary files in an unsafe manner.  A local user can create a symbolic link from a temporary file name to a critical file on the system.  Then, when a target user executes Speak Freely, the linked file may be overwritten by Speak Freely with the privileges of the target user.  According to the report, arbitrary data can be written.  \n\nThe condition occurs when PGP key exchange is used, where the 'speaker.c' file creates an unsafe temporary file in '/tmp'.  According to the vendor, if the target user's umask() is set insecurely, the session key could be viewed by a local user.  The same type of race condition occurs in several other code locations, the vendor reports.\n\nIt is also reported that a replay feature (the fLoopback facility) can be exploited to send UDP packets to arbitrary hosts.  If the feature is enabled, the target system will send back the same UDP packet as was received to the source IP address of the UDP packet.

    "Description": "A denial of service vulnerability was reported in the Sun Solaris 'cachefsd' cached NFS file system daemon.  A remote user can cause denial of service conditions and may be able to execute arbitrary code on the system with root level privileges.\neSecurityOnline reported that cachefsd does not properly handle RPC requests that contain an invalid procedure call. A remote user can send a specially crafted RPC request to cause cachefsd to crash.  Sun has reported that a remote user may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\n\nCisco reports that the operating system shipped with Cisco Media Gateway Controller may be vulnerable.\n\nProducts running on Solaris 2.5.1 are reportedly vulnerable unless CSCOh013.pkg release 1.0(9) or later has been installed. The product that is based on this version of Solaris is Signaling Controller 2200 (SC2200).\n\nProducts running on Solaris 2.6 are reportedly vulnerable unless CSCOh013.pkg release 1.0(9) or later has been installed. Products running on Solaris 8 are vulnerable unless CSCOh013.pkg release 2.0(2) or later has been installed. The products that are based on these versions of Solaris are:\n\no SC2200 \n\no Cisco Virtual Switch Controller (VSC3000)\n\no Cisco PGW2200 Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Gateway\n\no Cisco Billing and Management Server (BAMS)\n\no Cisco Voice Services Provisioning Tool (VSPT)\n\nCisco reports that the Media Gateway Controller itself is not vulnerable, but the underlying operating system supplied by Sun may be vulnerable.",

    "Solution": "No solution was available at the time of this entry.  Sun has issued the following workaround while a final resolution is pending:\n\nComment out cachefsd in /etc/inetd.conf as shown below:\n\nFor Solaris 2.6, 7 and 8:\n\n#100235/1 tli rpc/tcp wait root /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd  cachefsd\n\nFor Solaris 2.5.1:\n\n#100235/1 stream rpc/tcp wait root /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd  cachefsd            \n\nOnce the line is commented out either:\n\n- reboot, or\n- send a HUP signal to inetd(1M) and kill existing cachefsd processes, for example,\n\t  on Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 do the following:\n\t\t$ kill -HUP <PID of inetd>\n\t\t$ kill <PIDs of any cachefsd processes>\n\n\t  Solaris 7 and 8 do the following:\n\t\t$ pkill -HUP inetd\n\t\t$ pkill cachefsd                              \n\nThe possible side effects of the workaround are:\n\n- for systems not using cachefs:\n\nThere is no impact.\n\n- for systems using cachefs:\n\nOnly the \"disconnectable\" mount option is known to be affected by disabling cachefsd. This feature is rarely used outside of AutoClient and is undocumented.\n\nThe \"disconnectable\" option is specified at mount time using the usual mount syntax and is not enabled by default.\n\nIf cachefsd is disabled and the file server becomes unavailable then file systems mounted as \"disconnectable\" will not be reconnected when the service returns. For this reason we recommend that the \"disconnectable\" option is not used while cachefsd is disabled.\n\nMounts and unmounts should still succeed though an error message may be seen, e.g.\n\n  mount -F cachefs: cachefsd is not running\n\nThere is no performance impact.\n\n\n- for systems using AutoClient:\n\nIn addition to the advice given for systems using cachefs:\n\nOnly AutoClient systems using the \"disconnectable\" feature will be affected. Should the server become unavailable the root and /usr file systems will switch to disconnected mode as usual but will not be reconnected when the service returns. For this reason we recommend that the \"disconnectable\" option is not used with AutoClient while cachefsd is disabled on the client.\n\nIf cachefsd is disabled a warning message will appear during the boot of the AutoClient system:\n\nWARNING: Timed out waiting for cachefs service to register\n\nThis indicates that the cachefsd service is not available which is as expected.\n\nThere is no performance impact.",
