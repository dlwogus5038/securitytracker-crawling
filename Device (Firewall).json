A remote user can cause denial of service conditions against the target TCP connection or hijack the target TCP connection in certain cases. Palo Alto PAN-OS is affected.\nA remote user can conduct a side-channel attack against TCP connections to determine if two arbitrary hosts have established a TCP connection and to potentially hijack the connection in certain cases.\n\nA remote user that can establish a separate TCP connection to the target system can send specially crafted TCP RST and TCP SYN packets to cause the target system to respond with a number of challenge ACK packets that exceed the target system's challenge ACK maximum while at the same time sending spoofed packets with a source address of a second target system to the first target system. If the total maximum number of challenge ACK packets are returned to the remote user from the first target system, then the remote user can infer that a connection does not exist between the two target systems. If fewer than the maximum number of challenge ACK packets are returned to the remote user from the first target system, then the remote user can infer that there is an established TCP connection between the two target systems.\n\nA similar attack method can be used to determine correct TCP sequence numbers for a target TCP connection and then hijack the target connection.\n\nThe report indicates that an attack can be completed within 60 seconds or less, on average, and with an 88% to 97% success rate.\n\nThe vulnerability resides in the challenge ACK response mechanism and global rate limit mechanism specified in RFC 5961 and as implemented in the Linux kernel.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_cao.pdf\n\nYue Cao, Zhiyun Qian, Zhongjie Wang, Tuan Dao, of Srikanth V.

    "Description": "Some vulnerabilities were reported in Cisco ASA.  A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting and HTML injection attacks.  A remote user may be able to obtain the target user's authentication credentials in certain cases.\nA remote user can create specially crafted HTML that rewrites the \"CSCO_WebVPN['process']\" parameter with a function that will return arbitrary code [CVE-2009-1201].  Then, when the \"csco_wrap_js\" function is next called, the arbitrary code will be executed by target user's browser.  The code will originate from the ASA WebVPN site and will run in the security context of that site.  As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nCisco has assigned Cisco Bug ID CSCsy80694 to this vulnerability.\n\nA demonstration exploit is provided:\n\n<html><script>\nfunction a(b, c)\n{\n   return \"alert('Your VPN location:\\\\n\\\\n'+\" +\n   \"document.location+'\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\" +\n   \"Your VPN cookie:\\\\n\\\\n'+document.cookie);\";\n}\nCSCO_WebVPN['process'] = a;\ncsco_wrap_js('');\n</script></html>\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted request that, when loaded by the target user, will cause arbitrary HTML to be rendered in the ASA's DOM, permitting cross-site scripting attacks [CVE-2009-1202].\n\nCisco has assigned Cisco Bug ID CSCsy80705 to this vulnerability.\n\nThe device does not sufficiently differentiate the WebVPN login screen from login screens generated when the target user attempts to access a FTP or CIFS server [CVE-2009-1203].  A user may inadvertently send their WebVPN authentication credentials to a FTP or CIFS server.\n\nCisco has assigned Cisco Bug ID CSCsy80709 to this vulnerability.\n\nThe vendor was notified on March 31, 2009.\n\nDavid Byrne of Trustwave's SpiderLabs reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Solution": "Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and issued a security notice, available at:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-response-20051122-pix.shtml\n\nCisco previously provided the following workarounds [quoted]:\n\n1. Issuing the commands \"clear xlate\" or \"clear local-host <ip\naddress on the higher security level interface>\" will allow the\nfirewall to pass connections again.\n\n\n2. The default TCP embryonic connection timeout is 30 seconds. This\ndefault can also be modified which further mitigates the issue. This\nworkaround should be effective regardless of the cause of the issue.\n\nThis configuration example sets the TCP embryonic connection timeout\nto 10 seconds for the default \"global_policy\" policy-map:\n\naccess-list tcp_inspection extended permit tcp any any\naccess-list tcp_inspection extended deny ip any any\n\nclass-map my_inspection_tcp\n match access-list tcp_inspection\n\npolicy-map global_policy\n class my_inspection_tcp\n  set connection timeout embryonic 0:00:10\n\nservice-policy global_policy global\n\n\n3. TCP Intercept can be configured to allow the PIX to proxy all TCP\nconnection attempts originated from behind any firewall interface\nafter the first connection.  PIX will create and send the TCP SYN,ACK\nfrom the destination to the original source. Since the original TCP\nSYN packet was spoofed, the source IP address will not be tracking\nthe TCP connection and it will send a TCP RST to the PIX. The PIX\nwill then close the connection originating from the TCP SYN packet\nwith the invalid checksum. This workaround should be effective\nregardless of the cause of the issue.\n\nThis example proxies all TCP connection attempts originated from any\nfirewall interface\nafter the first connection for the default \"global_policy\"\npolicy-map:\n\naccess-list tcp_inspection extended permit tcp any any \naccess-list tcp_inspection extended deny ip any any \n\nclass-map my_inspection_tcp\n match access-list tcp_inspection\n\npolicy-map global_policy\n class my_inspection_tcp\n  set connection embryonic-conn-max 1 \n\nservice-policy global_policy global\n\n\n4. When invalid checksums are the cause of this issue, PIX/ASA\nsoftware version 7.0 can be configured to verify TCP checksums which\nwill eliminate the impact. Verifying TCP checksums may impact\nfirewall performance and should be tested before being enabled in a\nproduction environment.\n\nThis example verifies TCP packet checksums for the default\n\"global_policy\" policy-map:\n\ntcp-map verify-chksum\n  checksum-verification \n\naccess-list tcp_inspection extended permit tcp any any \naccess-list tcp_inspection extended deny ip any any \n\nclass-map my_inspection_tcp\n match access-list tcp_inspection\n\npolicy-map global_policy\n class my_inspection_tcp\n  set connection advanced-options verify-chksum\n\nservice-policy global_policy global",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in several TCP stack implementations.  A remote user may be able to cause denial of service conditions using a TCP reset attack.  Symantec Gateway Security is affected.\nThe UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre (NISCC) reported that some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are particularly vulnerable to TCP reset attacks.  A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities.  Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\".  In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated.  Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said.  However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number.  The Associate Press reports that the proper number can be guessed within as few as four attempts, requiring only seconds to achieve.\n\nThe report credits Paul A. Watson for discovering a practical method for conducting TCP reset attacks (presented in \"Slipping In The Window: TCP Reset Attacks\" at the CanSecWest 2004 conference).\n\nThe report indicates that the following vendors are affected [this is not an inclusive list]:\n\n- Cray Inc. is vulnerable on their UNICOS, UNICOS/mk and UNICOS/mp systems\n\n- Check Point is affected, but has issued a protection mechanism in the latest release for VPN-1/FireWall-1 (R55 HFA-03) that can protect both the firewall device and hosts located behind the firewall.\n\n- Internet Initiative Japan, Inc (IIJ) is affected.\n\n- InterNiche NicheStack and NicheLite are affected.\n\n- Juniper Networks products are affected.\n\n- Cisco products are affected, including IOS and non-IOS based devices.\n\nOther vendors are assessing the impact of this flaw.\n\nThe NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 236929 is available at:\n\nhttp://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/236929/index.htm",

The code will originate from the FortiGate device and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target administrator's cookies (including authentication cookies), associated with the firewall device, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the administrative interface, or take actions on the interface acting as the target administrator.\n\nSome demonstration exploit URLs are provided:\n\nhttps://172.16.1.254/firewall/policy/dlg?q=-1&fzone=t<script>alert('oops')</script>>&tzone=dmz\nhttps://172.16.1.254/firewall/policy/policy?fzone=internal&tzone=dmz1<script>alert('oops')</script>\nhttps://172.16.1.254/antispam/listdel?file=blacklist&name=b<script>alert('oops')</script>&startline=0\nhttps://172.16.1.254/antispam/listdel?file=whitelist&name=a<script>alert('oops')</script>&startline=0(naturally)\nhttp://172.16.1.254/theme1/selector?button=status,monitor,session\"><script>alert('oops')</script>&button_url=/system/status/status,/\nhttp://172.16.1.254/theme1/selector?button=status,monitor,session&button_url=/system/status/status\"><script>alert('oops')</script>,/\nhttp://172.16.1.254/theme1/selector?button=status,monitor,session&button_url=/system/status/status,/system/status/moniter\"><script>alert('\nhttp://172.16.1.254/theme1/selector?button=status,monitor,session&button_url=/system/status/status,/system/status/moniter,/system/status/session&quo&;\n\nIt is also reported that the username and MD5 hash of the user's password are stored in cookie.

A remote user may be able to cause arbitrary code to be executed on a server application that uses OpenSSL.  Cisco confirms that Cisco PIX Firewall is affected, but that the impact is limited to denial of service conditions.\nIt is reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted SSL client certificate containing invalid ASN.1 tag values to trigger a flaw in OpenSSL and cause OpenSSL to crash due to \"out of bounds reads\" (CVE: CVE-2003-0543 and CVE-2003-0544).  These flaws affected 0.9.6 and 0.9.7.  The specific impact depends on the application using OpenSSL.  The report indicates that the effects against Apache (when using OpenSSL) are \"limited\" and only cause Apache httpd child processes to crash.\n\nIt is also reported that certain ASN.1 encodings detected to be invalid may trigger a double free of the ASN1_TYPE variable, deallocating memory that has already been deallocated (CVE: CVE-2003-0545).  This flaw only affects 0.9.7.  A remote user may be able to send a specially crafted SSL client certificate to an application that uses OpenSSL to potentially execute arbitrary code.  The exact impact depends on how the application uses OpenSSL.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can specify an invalid public key in a certificate to cause the verify code to crash if the target server is configured to ignore public key decoding errors.  The vendor notes that ignoring public key decoding errors is usually only done in debugging situations and not usually in production code.  [Editor's note:  A CVE number had not yet been assigned to this issue at the time of this entry.]\n\nNISCC is credited with discovering these vulnerabilities.\n\nThe vendor reports a fourth related security issue, where an error in the SSL/TLS protocol handling will cause a server to parse a client certificate even when a client certificate is not specifically requested.

A remote user with access to the encrypted stream may be able to establish an unauthorized VPN session in certain situations.  A remote user may be able to cause the firewall to crash.\nCisco issued an advisory reporting that the PIX does not delete duplicate Internet Security Authentication Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) Security Associations (SAs) with the peer VPN entity when processing initial contact notify messages.  After a valid user establishes an authenticated VPN session, the PIX will create an ISAKMP SA associating the user with the user's IP address.  A malicious remote user that can block the valid user's connection and establish a connection to the PIX using the same IP address as that of the valid user can establish a VPN session with the PIX.  If the remote user has access to the peer authentication key (i.e., the group pre-shared key [PSK] or group password key), then the remote user's VPN session will be authenticated (via peer authentication).  Cisco has assigned Bug ID CSCdv83490 to this vulnerability.\n\nCisco also reported that a remote user can cause the PIX to crash due to a buffer overflow while processing HTTP traffic requests for authentication using TACACS+ or RADIUS authentication servers.  Cisco has assigned Bug ID CSCdx35823 to this vulnerability.",

The opened connection can apparently be used for any protocol.\n\nA demonstration exploit transcript is provided (for a remote attack against a target server on port 5000):\n\nAttacker: Connect to FTP server and login\nAttacker: \"RETR 227 Connect to me at (192,168,0,10,19,136)\\r\\n\" [2]\nServer  : \"5xx No such file: 227 Connect to me at ([...])\\r\\n\"\nAttacker: Sends TCP ACK for the (here) 18 first bytes, i.e. \"5xx No such file: \", NOT the whole packet, which leaves the \"227 Connect to me\" string in the send queue of the server.

Since the NetScreen-5XP can support 2,048 concurrent sessions, NetScreen recommends the higher of the following two numbers as a starting point:  100, or 2048/n where \"n\" is the number of systems on the \"Trust\" side network.  Administrators are advised to check their flow counters to see if that's an acceptable number, and modify accordingly.\n\nNext, releases of ScreenOS 3.0.0 and later allow the administrator to forcibly clear sessions based on characteristics of those sessions such as source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, source MAC address, and/or destination MAC address.\n\nFor example, the command\n\nclear session dst-ip <a.b.c.d>\n\nwill clear all active sessions to destination IP address a.b.c.d from the NetScreen active session table. This command can be used to recover from a wild port scan without waiting for all sessions to age out or without resetting the NetScreen device.\n\nLastly, ScreenOS 3.1.0 and later allow the administrator to enable firewall protections, including port scan protections, on any interface. \n\nNetScreen recommends all customers to upgrade to the latest version of ScreenOS supported by their hardware and then to enable one or all of the above features to minimize the likelihood of being affected by this issue.\n\nThe latest currently available versions of ScreenOS at the time of this writing for each NetScreen device are:\n\nHardware,                ScreenOS release\nNetScreen-5,                     2.6.1r6\nNetScreen-5XP,           3.0.1r1\nNetScreen-10,            3.0.1r1\nNetScreen-25,            3.0.0r1\nNetScreen-50,            3.0.0r1\nNetScreen-100,           3.0.1r1\nNetScreen-204,           3.1.0r1\nNetScreen-208,           3.1.0r1\nNetScreen-500,           3.1.0r1\nNetScreen-1000,          2.8.0r1\"",
