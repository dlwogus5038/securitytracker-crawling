    "Solution": "The vendor has released a fix, available at:\n\nhttp://support.novell.com/servlet/filedownload/pub/httpstk1.exe/\n\nNovell has provided the following fix information, available at the Vendor URL:\n\nFor NetWare 5.1, Novell recommends that customers have Support Pack 3 installed on their servers prior to the installation of this fix.\n\nFor NetWare 6, this fix can be applied to a NetWare 6 server either with or without Support Pack 1 installed.\n\nMethod #1: Use NWCONFIG.NLM and install the patch automatically.\nMethod #2: Manually copy the files to the server.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nMethod #1\n1. Run HTTPSTK1.EXE, unzipping the files into a directory.\n\n2. If the directory where the files were extracted is not located on the server to be updated, copy that directory structure to the server to be updated.\n\n3. Load NWCONFIG.NLM on the server to be updated.\n\n4. On the main menu of NWCONFIG.NLM, select \"Product Options\". This will display a new menu. On this new menu, select \"Install a product not listed\" and then press <ENTER>.\n\n5. Follow the on screen prompts to correctly select the location of the directory to where the patch was extracted on the server.\n\n6. Press <F10> to start the file copy procedure.\n\nMethod #2\n1. Flag the older version of httpstk.nlm appropriately so that it can be over written with the new version of httpstk.nlm. This file is located on the server's SYS: volume in the system directory.\n\n2. Copy the newer version of httpstk.nlm to the server's SYS:system directory.\n\n3. Flag the file to be RO SH.\n\nAfter the installation of the file is complete, the new code can either be enabled manually, or automatically. The manual method requires knowledge of the command line switches httpstk.nlm uses on loading. These switches are found in the autoexec.ncf file (in the SYS:system directory). Unload portal.nlm and httpstk.nlm and then reload httpstk.nlm (with the correct switches) and portal.nlm. This will reenable Novell Remote Manager with the new code.\n\nThe automatic method of enabling the code is a server reboot. Once the NLM has been copied into the SYS:system directory, the server will automatically use it (if asked to) when booting.\n\nNote that the internal date displayed using the modules list on the server may not match the date of the actual physical file. This behavior is normal and does not indicate a problem.\n\nNetWare 5.1 and NetWare 6 include NetWare Remote Manager by default.\n\nNetWare 5.1 Support Pack 5 will include this new version of httpstk.nlm.\nNetWare 6 Support Pack 2 will include this new version of httpstk.nlm.",
