Yes\n9???????       Yes\n\nIn the example above, the first line will match and block all domestic (US) toll calls. The second line will match and block all international calls including the international operator. The third line matches and allows local calls. This line is not necessary if your area does not use local area codes. The fourth line matches and allows local calls. This or other locally applicable lines should be applied to all restriction tables. Note that some locations use 10 digit dialing for non-toll calls. In those locations the restrictions should allow specific non-toll prefixes while blocking all other toll prefixes.\n\nFor installations outside of North America where the dial plans vary from the above example, the restriction table entries will be different. Information to assist in creating restriction tables can be found in the section entitled \"Restriction Tables\" in the Cisco Unity System Administration Guide.\n\nIn addition, Cisco recommends the protection of the Example Administrator and the Example Subscriber accounts. These accounts at a minimum should have their default extension and default password changed. This should be done as part of tightening the security on your Cisco Unity system. For more details refer to: \n\nWhite Paper: Best Practices for Cisco Unity 3.0\n\nIt is also possible to remove the Example Administrator and the Example Subscriber accounts. Care must be taken in removing the Example Administrator account, as removing it improperly could result in the Cisco Unity server no longer functioning properly. The process to remove those accounts has been documented at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/788/AVVID/remove_example_admin.html\n\nOther methods of mitigating the risk are:\n\n1. If Unity is integrated with a Call Manager, adding a route filter to the route pattern Unity uses to dial to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) will prevent calls to the international operator.\n2. Restricting Unity from placing calls to the PSTN if that capability is not needed.\n3. Apply a good password policy. Refer to the white paper on Best Practices for Cisco Unity 3.0\"",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in the Cisco 7960 IP Phone.  A remote user can gain complete control over the phone, modify its settings, hijack calls, and make calls.\nThe Sys-Security Group released a paper outlining multiple flaws in the IP phone.\n\nAccording to the report, the phone's use of TFTP introduces many weaknesses.  Because the TFTP protocol does not provide for authentication, a remote user can retrieve phone configuration files from the TFTP server and subvert all IP Phones on the target user's network.\n\nFor example, the 'SIPDefault.cnf' file may contain the 'phone_password' parameter used to grant telnet access to the phone.  Apparently, all phones are likely to have the same telnet password.  Some may also use the default password of 'cisco'.  Then, the remote user can download the phone-specific configuration file from the TFTP server.  Or, the remote user can telnet to the IP Phone.\n\nIn the phone-specific configuration file, the remote user can view the 'linex_authname' and 'linex_password' credentials used to authenticated to the IP telephone network.  This allows the remote user to perform toll fraud, hijack phone calls, and perform other misdeed on the telephony network.\n\nAlso, the firmware image is reportedly downloaded and installed without authentication, allowing a remote user with write access to the TFTP server to modify the image.  An image could also possibly be modified during download.\n\nIt is reported that these vulnerabilities exist in any environment, including that recommended by Cisco for large-scale deployments.\n\nThe paper is available (in Adobe Acrobat PDF format) at:\n\nhttp://www.sys-security.com/archive/papers/The_Trivial_Cisco_IP_Phones_Compromise.pdf",

A remote user can gain access to the phone, including administrative access, manipulate Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling, and cause denial of service conditions.\n@Stake reported that Pingtel xpressa SIP model PX-1 telephones contain a whole slew of security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt is reported that the phone provides a web interface for placing calls, managing applications, and configuring various settings.  Access to this interface is controlled using HTTP basic authentication, which allows a remote user with access to the local network to sniff the passwords.  \n\nAlso, the default configuration of the phone has no administrator password for the \"admin\" account.\n\nOn systems that have not had the administrator password set, a remote user can login as an administrator and gain full control of the phone's settings.  With this control, the remote user can reportedly gain complete control over the SIP signaling path and the audio stream.  Calls can be hijacked by modifying the 'Call Forwarding' settings (apparently, no indication is provided on the phone that calls have been maliciously forwarded).  Incoming calls can be created by setting the SIP_TCP_PORT and the SIP_UDP_PORT to the same non-zero non-default value.\n\nOnce the administrator password has been set, a remote user (that has sniffed the password) can gain telnet access to the underlying VxWorks operating system.\n\nA remote user can also modify the DNS settings to point to a malicious DNS server that provides a malicious host address for the http://appsrv.pingtel.com application server.  This allows the remote user to cause malicious applications to be loaded to the device.\n\nA physically local user can reportedly reset the administrative password, returning it to its default configuration (which is a null password).\n\nOther various bugs and non-secure features are reported.\n\nFor more detailed information, see the original @Stake advisory:\n\nhttp://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2002/a071202-1.txt",

A remote user can also send a specially crafted HTTP request to an IP Phone's built-in web server to cause the phone to reinitialize.  This is reportedly due to an input validation flaw.

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in COM2001's Alexis Internet-based PBX.  Remote users can sniff another user's voicemail password and gain access to that user's phone applications.\nIt is reported that the Alexis system has a web access component that integrates with Microsoft Exchange Outlook Web Access.  This web access component queries the user for the voicemail password, then opens a Java applet that connects back to the Alexis server using a default port of 8888.  The username and voicemail password is passed from the applet to the server without encryption.\n\nIt is also reported that the voicemail passwords are stored in plaintext in a file called com2001.ini on the server, however, this can be protected using appropriate operating system file permissions.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can sniff the network connection between the target user's web access Java applet and the Alexis server to obtain the target user's voicemail password.  It is reported that this password can then enable the remote user to make long distance phone calls on the system or make calls that appear to originate from the target user's phone number.",
    "Solution": "The vendor reportedly confirms the flaw and intends to correct it in the next service pack.\n\nThe author of the report suggests a workaround of blocking port 8888 to the Alexis server until the service pack is available.  This will reportedly disable some of the web access features, such as call screening.  Another workaround is to downgrade to version 1.1, which does not send the voicemail password via the webaccess function.",

    "Exploit Included": "Yes",
    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in Avaya's Alchemy ArgentOffice phone system.  These security holes allow remote users to deny service to the system or to gain administrative access to the system.\nA remote user can send a UDP packet with no data payload to port 53 to cause the system to reboot.  If a remote user repeatedly sends these packets, service can be continually denied.\n\nThe system uses a non-secure configuration method that sends the configuration password over the network via TFTP.  Remote configuration is apparently performed using TFTP.  For example, to reboot a unit, a remote user must use the following file:\n\nnasystem/rebootwhenfree/00e007002666/password//\n\nIn this example, 00e007002666 is the MAC address of the unit and 'password' is the obfuscated administrative password.   This packet can be readily sniffed by a remote user on the local LAN and the obfuscation algorithm can be defeated, giving the remote user administrative access to the system.\n\nThe system also allows remote users on the local network to use zero length SNMP passwords to obtain SNMP information.\n\nSome demonstration exploit code is included in the Source Message.",
