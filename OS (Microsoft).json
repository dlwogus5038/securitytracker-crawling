Windows Kernel is affected.\nA local user can exploit race conditions in CPU data cache processing to obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "Two vulnerabilities were reported in Microsoft Windows systems with Kerberos and PKINIT.  A remote user can cause denial of service conditions, gain access to sensitive information about the network, or spoof a server on the network.\nThe Kerberos vulnerability can be exploited by a remote user to cause a denial of service for users trying to authenticate to Active Directory.  The exploit is performed by sending a specially crafted message to a Windows domain controller that authenticates users in an Active Directory domain.  The Active Directory authentication service may stop responding.\n\nThe PKINIT vulnerability can be exploited by a remote user with access to an authentication session between the target client and the target domain controller.  The remote user can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to modify certain network traffic from the domain controller to gain access to sensitive client communications.  Users can be tricked into accessing a malicious server rather than the actual domain controller.  \n\nWindows 2000 and later versions use Kerberos as the default authentication protocol.\n\nTony Chin of Shell, Inc. reported the Kerberos vulnerability to Microsoft.  Andre Scedrov and his team; Iliano Cervesato, Aaron Jaggard, Joe-Kai Tsay, and Chris Walstad reported the PKINIT vulnerability to Microsoft.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in several TCP stack implementations.  A remote user may be able to cause denial of service conditions using a TCP reset attack.  Microsoft Windows is affected.\nThe UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre (NISCC) reported that some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are particularly vulnerable to TCP reset attacks.  A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities.  Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\".  In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated.  Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said.  However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number.  The Associate Press reports that the proper number can be guessed within as few as four attempts, requiring only seconds to achieve.\n\nThe report credits Paul A. Watson for discovering a practical method for conducting TCP reset attacks (presented in \"Slipping In The Window: TCP Reset Attacks\" at the CanSecWest 2004 conference).\n\nThe report indicates that the following vendors are affected [this is not an inclusive list]:\n\n- Cray Inc. is vulnerable on their UNICOS, UNICOS/mk and UNICOS/mp systems\n\n- Check Point is affected, but has issued a protection mechanism in the latest release for VPN-1/FireWall-1 (R55 HFA-03) that can protect both the firewall device and hosts located behind the firewall.\n\n- Internet Initiative Japan, Inc (IIJ) is affected.\n\n- InterNiche NicheStack and NicheLite are affected.\n\n- Juniper Networks products are affected.\n\n- Cisco products are affected, including IOS and non-IOS based devices.\n\nOther vendors are assessing the impact of this flaw.\n\nThe NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 236929 is available at:\n\nhttp://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/236929/index.htm",

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in Microsoft Windows in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) implementation. A remote user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the target system.  The \"Sasser\" worm is actively exploiting this flaw.\neEye Digital Security reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted message to the target service (LSASRV.DLL) to trigger a buffer overflow and cause the system to execute arbitrary code. A remote or local user may be able to cause another component to pass a specially crafted message to the affected service to trigger the flaw.\n\nThe affected function is a logging function in LSASRV.DLL that makes a vsprintf() function call without validating the input. As a result, a long string argument sent to the logging function can trigger the overflow. eEye Digital Security reports that there are some RPC functions that will accept a long string as a parameter and attempt to write the value to the debug log file. For example, the DsRolerDcAsDc() API can reportedly be exploited via a specially crafted DnsDomainName, SiteName, or SystemVolumeRootPath or other parameter. Additional technical details about the affected functions is provided in the Source Message.\n\nMicrosoft indicates that on Windows 2000 and XP, a remote user can exploit this flaw but that on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, only a local administrator can exploit this flaw.\n\nWindows NT 4.0 is reportedly not affected.\n\nThis flaw may affect ports including port 135, 137, 138, 139, 445, and 593.\n\nMicrosoft has assigned a 'Critical' severity rating to Windows 2000 and XP and a 'Low' severity rating to Windows Server 2003.\n\nMicrosoft credits eEye Digital Security with reporting this flaw. \n\nSeveral anti-virus vendors reported that the \"Sasser\" worm is actively exploiting this vulnerability.\n\nThe worm reportedly scans random IP addresses for an open TCP port 445.  If the scanned system is vulnerable, the worm attempts to trigger the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the target system.  The executed code on the scanned host runs an FTP script to download the actual worm code from the attacking host via FTP on TCP port 5554.\n\nThe worm copies itself to 'avserve.exe' (and to other files) in the Windows system directory and creates the following registry key to ensure that the worm is executed upon startup:\n\n  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\n  CurrentVersion\\Run \"avserve.exe\" = C:\\WINDOWS\\avserve.exe\n\nThe worm creates the file 'c:\\win.log'.\n\nThe worm may cause LSASS.EXE to crash.\n\nF-Secure has assigned a \"Level 2\" rating to the Sasser worm.  Trend Micro has assigned a \"Low\" risk rating.",

One of the threads may free the memory allocated to hold the incoming packet before the other thread is finished processing the packet.  As a result, a memory error may occur.\n\nA remote user can send specially crafted packets to the target system to cause the target RPC service to crash.  It may also be possible to cause the target system to reboot, according to the report.  ISS says that thousands of packets may be required to trigger the flaw.\n\neEye Digital Security later reported that a remote user can execute arbitrary code on the target system.\n\nSystems patched with the MS03-039 patch are vulnerable, the report said.\n\nISS warned that ports 135, 137, 138, 139, 445, 593 may be used as attack vectors in exploiting this vulnerability.\n\nISS also clarified that some reports have incorrectly suggested that this flaw is a variant of the flaw described in MS03-039.\n\nThe vendor was reportedly notified on October 13, 2003.\n\neEye Digital Security later reported that the vendor was notified by eEye of the same (or very similar) flaw on September 10, 2003.",

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in Microsoft Windows in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) implementation.  A remote user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the target system.\neEye Digital Security reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted message to the target service (LSASRV.DLL) to trigger a buffer overflow and cause the system to execute arbitrary code.  A remote or local user may be able to cause another component to pass a specially crafted message to the affected service to trigger the flaw.\n\nThe affected function is a logging function in LSASRV.DLL that makes a vsprintf() function call without validating the input.  As a result, a long string argument sent to the logging function can trigger the overflow.  eEye Digital Security reports that there are some RPC functions that will accept a long string as a parameter and attempt to write the value to the debug log file.  For example, the DsRolerDcAsDc() API can reportedly be exploited via a specially crafted DnsDomainName, SiteName, or SystemVolumeRootPath or other parameter.  Additional technical details about the affected functions is provided in the Source Message.\n\nMicrosoft indicates that on Windows 2000 and XP, a remote user can exploit this flaw but that on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, only a local administrator can exploit this flaw.\n\nWindows NT 4.0 is reportedly not affected.\n\nThis flaw may affect ports including port 135, 137, 138, 139, 445, and 593.\n\nMicrosoft has assigned a 'Critical' severity rating to Windows 2000 and XP and a 'Low' severity rating to Windows Server 2003.\n\nMicrosoft credits eEye Digital Security with reporting this flaw.",

The NtSystemDebugControl() function reportedly executes in ring 0 (i.e., kernel mode).\n\nIt is reported that a local user with appropriate privileges can use the SYSENTER/SYSCALL instructions (via the NtSystemDebugControl() function) to write to the IA32_SYSENTER_EIP model specific register (MSR) and change the MSR to point to the user's arbitrary code.\n\nIt is also reported that a local user can modify an interrupt dispatch table (IDT) entry to point to the user's arbitrary code and then call an interrupt.  A flaw in the read I/O sub-function of NtSystemDebugControl() reportedly fails to validate the pointers in the IO_STRUCT, so the kernel can be made to read from an I/O port (e.g., BIOS POST port 80h).   The local user can first write to an I/O port and then use the exploit method to read the value and have the kernel write an arbitrary byte to an arbitrary address.\n\nA similar vulnerability is reported in the DebugSysReadBusData() and DebugSysWriteBusData() functions, where the BUS_STRUCT values are not validated.

    "Description": "A race condition vulnerability was reported in Microsoft Windows in the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service.  A remote user can cause the RPC service to crash or execute arbitrary code.\nInternet Security Systems (ISS) reproted that there is a multi-threaded race condition in the processing of incoming RPC requests. Due to a flaw in the software, two separate threads may attempt to process the same incoming RPC request.  One of the threads may free the memory allocated to hold the incoming packet before the other thread is finished processing the packet.  As a result, a memory error may occur.\n\nA remote user can send specially crafted packets to the target system to cause the target RPC service to crash.  It may also be possible to cause the target system to reboot, according to the report.  ISS says that thousands of packets may be required to trigger the flaw.\n\neEye Digital Security later reported that a remote user can execute arbitrary code on the target system.\n\nSystems patched with the MS03-039 patch are vulnerable, the report said.\n\nISS warned that ports 135, 137, 138, 139, 445, 593 may be used as attack vectors in exploiting this vulnerability.\n\nISS also clarified that some reports have incorrectly suggested that this flaw is a variant of the flaw described in MS03-039.\n\nThe vendor was reportedly notified on October 13, 2003.\n\neEye Digital Security later reported that the vendor was notified by eEye of the same (or very similar) flaw on September 10, 2003.",

    "Description": "Several buffer overflow vulnerabilities were reported in several Microsoft operating systems in the RPCSS service related to Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) messages.  A remote user can execute arbitrary code with Local System privileges or cause denial of service conditions.\nIt is reported that the RPCSS service contains several vulnerabilities in the processing of RPC DCOM object activation requests that can be triggered by a remote user sending malformed messages.\n\nIt is reported that a remote user can establish a connection to the target system and then send a specially crafted and malformed RPC message to cause the DCOM activation infrastructure to execute arbitrary, user-supplied code.  This is because user-supplied inputs are not properly checked by the software, according to the report.  The flaws reportedly occur in the processing of RPC DCOM object activation requests.\n\nSome of the vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.  Another vulnerability results in the RPCSS service crashing and only affects Windows 2000.\n\nInternet Security Systems separately reported that there is a buffer overflow in the Message Queue Manager on Windows 2000 [CVE: CVE-2003-0995].  A remote user can reportedly send a specially-crafted queue registration request to trigger the overflow and execute arbitrary code on the system with Local System privileges.\n\nMicrosoft reports that the affected service may initially receive connections via UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445 and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593.  In addition, the systems can be configured to receive RPC connections via TCP on 80 and 443.  Other ports may also be used.\n\nOne of these buffer overflow vulnerabilities is related to the exploit code released by XFocus on July 25, 2003 and described in Alert ID 1007302 [the exploit was also reportedly effective against CVE CVE-2003-0352].\n\nTechnical details regarding another of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities has been provided by eEye Digital Security [see the Message History for a separate Alert dedicated to the eEye advisory].  In this particular buffer overflow, a remote user can reportedly send a DCERPC \"bind\" packet followed by a malformed DCERPC DCOM object activation request packet.  The activate packet can contain specially crafted length fields to cause heap memory to be overwritten with user-supplied data, the report said.  It may require several activation packets (e.g., 4, 5) to cause the memory to be overwritten.\n\nMicrosoft credits eEye Digital Security, NSFOCUS Security Team, and Xue Yong Zhi and Renaud Deraison from Tenable Network Security with reporting these flaws.",

A remote user can send a query to UDP port 137 and monitor the response.  In some cases where padding is required in the response packet, the system may fail to properly pad the packet.  This may occur because the buffer created for a NBNS reply is not initialized before the buffer is used.\n\nAccording to the report, the remote user cannot control what information is disclosed.  However, a remote user can generate a large number of queries to attempt to retrieve a larger amount of random memory contents.

    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in the Microsoft Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service implementation. A remote user can execute arbitrary code on the system.  Microsoft has issued a PSS Security Response Team Alert regarding the W32.Blaster.worm that is actively exploiting this vulnerability.\nA remote user can reportedly send a malformed Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) object activation request to the target server to cause arbitrary code to be executed. The code will run with Local System privileges, according to the report.\n\nMicrosoft notes that the bug does not reside in the RPC endpoint mapper (which listens on that port), but rather, the bug resides in a low level DCOM interface. Microsoft credits The Last Stage of Delirium Research Group with reporting this flaw.\n\nOn August 11, 2003, the security community noticed that the \"Blaster\" worm had started exploiting this vulnerability on a significant number of systems.  The worm scans random IP addresses looking for vulnerable systems running on TCP port 135.  If the worm finds a vulnerable system, the worm executes code on the target system.  The code then downloads and executes the \"msblast.exe\" file via TFTP.  This creates the following Windows registry key:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \"windows auto update\" = msblast.exe I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!! bill\n\nInfected systems may reboot every minute or so.  However, some infected systems will appear to operate normally.\n\nTo determine whether your system has been infected, you can search for a \"msblast.exe\" file in the WINDOWS SYSTEM32 directory.\n\nMicrosoft has provided the following reference links from various anti-virus software vendors for more information on the worm and how to repair an infected system:\n\nhttp://us.mcafee.com/virusInfo/default.asp?id=description&virus_k=100547\nhttp://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_MSBLAST.A\nhttp://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.blaster.worm.html\nhttp://www3.ca.com/virusinfo/virus.aspx?ID=36265\n\nTo protect against this worm, Microsoft says that you should block TCP ports 135, 139, 445 and 593 to protect the RPC service, as well as UDP 69 (TFTP)and TCP 4444 to prevent some worm-related communications.",

A remote user acting as a malicious SMB server can gain access to a target user's shared resources.\nIt is reported that a remote user, acting as an SMB server, can gain access to user-level file and printer sharing services in certain cases.  The remote user must entice the target user to connect to the malicious SMB server to exploit the flaw.

Instead of responding with a challenge, the malicious SMB server turns and acts as an SMB client and sends a request to the SMB services on the target user's host.  The SMB server on the target user's host will, of course, respond with a challenge, which the malicious SMB client then sends to the malicious SMB server on behalf of the original target host.  The malicious SMB server then sends the challenge back to the original target host.\n\nAt this point, the target host will perform the proper NTLM authentication steps, encrypting the password with the received challenge, sending the results back to the malicious SMB server.

Since then, it has been reported that other non-IIS applications running on Windows 2000 are also vulnerable.  A remote user could execute arbitrary code with Local System privileges. \nA remote user can send a specially crafted packet to the server to trigger the buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.  If exploited via IIS, the code will run in the Local System security context, giving the remote user full control of the system. CERT reported in advisory CA-2003-09 that an exploit for this flaw has been publicly circulated [Editor's note:  see the Message History for an alert that references some exploit code].\n\nIn the original alert, it was reported that the buffer overflow resides in ntdll.dll, used by the IIS WebDAV component.  NGSSoftware more recently reported that many other applications use this DLL and are affected, not just IIS.  The vulnerable function, RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U, can reportedly be accessed by applications other than the IIS WebDAV application.  Some of the DLLs that use this function and therefore may represent exploit vectors include acledit.dll, advapi32.dll, cscdll.dll, csrsrv.dll, dskquoui.dll, eventlog.dll, gdi32.dll, ifsutil.dll, lsasrv.dll, ntdll.dll, ntmarta.dll, ole32.dll, perfproc.dll, query.dll, rshx32.dll, scesrv.dll, sdbapiu.dll, setupdll.dll, sfc.dll, shell32.dll, shim.dll, srvsvc.dll, svcpack.dll, trkwks.dll, ulib.dll, and wow32.dll, according to the report.  The NGSSoftware paper suggests that various web, ftp, and e-mail (IMAP) servers, anti-virus implementations, and various Microsoft Windows services may be invoked to exploit this buffer overflow flaw.\n\nFor the full NGSSoftware paper, see:\n\nhttp://www.nextgenss.com/papers/ms03-007-ntdll.pdf\n\nWindows NT, XP, and Windows Server 2003 are reportedly not affected.",

A remote user could cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target system.\nIt is reported that there is a buffer overflow in the Windows Script Engine in the processing of JScript code.  A remote user could create malicious HTML content that, when loaded by a target user, could execute arbitrary code on the target user's computer with the privileges of the target user.  An exploit could be delivered via a web page or HTML-based e-mail message.\n\nMicrosoft reported that automatic exploitation via an HTML-based email is not possible when using the default configuration of Outlook Express 6.0 and Outlook 2002 or when using Outlook 98 and 2000 in conjunction with the Outlook Email Security Update.\n\niDEFENSE subsequently issued an advisory providing additional details about this vulnerability.

A remote user could cause the system to crash or execute arbitrary code on the system.\nIt is reported that a buffer overflow exists in a Windows Shell function used to extract custom attribute information from audio files.  A remote user could create a specially crafted .MP3 or .WMA audio file containing a corrupt custom attribute.  Then, when the target user views the file via the Windows Desktop (e.g., placing the mouse pointer over the file icon, opening a folder containing the file), arbitrary code may be executed.  \n\nA malicious audio file could be delivered via HTML-based e-mail, with the code executed when the target user opened or previewed the e-mail, depending on the target user's e-mail system and configuration.  According to Microsoft, a target user with an e-mail client that displays HTML e-mail in the \"Restricted Sites\" Security Zone and with Windows XP SP1 or any of the recent cumulative patches for Internet Explorer can only be exploited if the target user clicks on the HTML link in the e-mail.\n\nThe file could also be delivered via a network file share or via a web site.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, playing an audio file with Windows Media Player does not trigger the vulnerability because the flaw is in the operating system shell and not in the media player.\n\nMalicious files can be safely removed using the Command Prompt.\n\nMicrosoft credits Foundstone Research Labs with reporting this issue.",

    "Description": "Vulnerabilities were reported in several Java components of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  A remote user could cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target user's computer.\nIn the original Alert, it was reported that some of the Microsoft Java native method implementations contain buffer overflows due to the lack of proper parameter checking and other errors, such as improper visibility declarations (e.g., public, private). A remote user could write a Java applet that, when loaded by a target user, would allow the applet to access files on the target user's system, access other resources on the system, and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the target user. According to the report, these bugs can be exploited via web pages or HTML-based e-mail.\n\nMicrosoft released a patch to correct some of these flaws (see the Message History). However, most of the originally reported flaws remain, as described below. Jouko Pynnonen is the author of both reports.\n\n1) A URL parsing error error that allows a remote user to impersonate a web site and steal the target user's cookies. The Java code does not correctly parse URLs that contain a colon to specify the port number. For example, in the following URL, the browser will load the web page from the \"URL_to_be_impersonated\" but will load the applet code from the \"malicious_site\":\n\nhttp://[malicious_site]:80@[URL_to_be_impersonated]\n\nIt may be possible to steal the target user's cookies under certain restricted circumstances.\n\n2) A stack overflow in class loader may cause denial of service conditions. A buffer overflow can be triggered when a class with a long name is loaded. This can happen with Class.forName() or ClassLoader.loadClass(), for example. It will cause the browser to crash. According to the report, is is unlikely to permit shellcode to be executed.\n\n3) A file path discovery bug allows a remote user to determine the current directory and username. A remote user (a Java applet on a server) can determine the current directory of the target user's Internet Explorer process by executing new File(\".\").getAbsolutePath(). According to the report, this will typically reveal the desktop path (including the username).\n\n4) INativeServices memory can be accessed and may permit arbitrary code to be executed. An applet may request an instance of com.ms.awt.peer.INativeServices by calling SystemX.getNativeServices(). The browser can be crashed by passing invalid parameters. An applet may be able to read the process's memory space via the method pGetFontEnumeratedFamily() to retrieve sensitive information (e.g., cookies, recent URLs). This method can also be exploited to determine the path to Internet Explorer's cache directories, which permits certain codebase attacks.\n\n5) INativeServices clipboard access is possible. An applet can use the ClipBoardGetText() and ClipBoardSetText() methods to access and modify clipboard contents. The methods are accessible by any applet. The methods must be called indirectly via the package java.lang.reflect.*, according to the report.\n\n6) The codebase in the applet tag can be set to \"file://%00\", giving the applet read access to all files and directory listings on the local computer and network shares. To achieve this, the applet must be loaded from a publicly readable network share.\n\n7) The StandardSecurityManager restrictions can be bypassed by altering or emptying the com.ms.security.StandardSecurityManager class package access restrictions (deniedDefinitionPackages, deniedAccessPackages).\n\n8) The load0() method of the com.ms.vm.loader.CabCracker class may be able to be exploited to load 'cab' archives.\n\n9) HTML objects can be passed to Java applets via JavaScript. The applet could possibly be made to invoke methods of some proprietary Microsoft interfaces, which may cause the browser to crash.\n\n10) The HTML <applet> tag can bypass Java class restrictions and instantiate objects whose constructors are private. This can cause the browser to crash, and may permit a remote user to modify memory to execute arbitrary code.",

A remote user with access to the SMB packet stream between a network client and server could gain access to the client.\nIt is reported that the SMB protocol, used for (among other things) disseminating group policy information from domain controllers to newly logged on systems, contains a flaw in applying digital signatures.  A remote user with access to the SMB packet stream could cause the SMB Signing settings to be \"silently downgraded.\"\n\nA remote user with access to the session negotiation packet stream could reportedly modify the data stream to cause either or both target system to send unsigned data instead of using the signing policy set by the administrator.  Once the packet data is transmitted in an unsigned format, the remote user could then modify the session data without detection.\n\nIt is reported that Windows XP clients with SP1 may inadvertently trigger the flaw. According to Microsoft, Windows XP SP1 contained a regression error that adds information to the SMB Signing negotiation information that can cause Windows XP Gold or Windows 2000 systems to drop SMB signing.  However, XP SP1 is not vulnerable.",

A remote user with access to the encrypted data stream may determine information about the unencrypted data and can modify the stream without detection.\nIt is reported that RDP leaks information about the contents of encrypted packets due to a weakness in computing the checksums, as packets with the same plaintext have matching checksums.  All versions of Windows using encrypted RDP are apparently affected.\n\nIn RDP 5.0, some common commands, including user input events, can reportedly be sent via special packets where only the key code and key event type (press, repeat, or release) is transmitted.   In this case, a timestamp is not sent.  As a result, the packet checksum is the same for each key event type for the same key.  A remote user monitoring the encrypted packet stream can therefore determine when the same key has been pressed, even though the key itself is not disclosed.  By monitoring a large amount of session data and performing an analysis of key patterns and frequencies within the session, a remote user could determine the actual keys pressed by the victim.  This could be used to capture passwords.\n\nAlso, it is reported that RDP version 5.0 allows a remote user with access to the encrypted data stream to manipulate keystrokes sent via the network.\n\nAccording to the report, if the victim presses \"A\" and the remote user wants to modify this to be a \"B\" key press, the remote user can obtain the desired cyphertext by XORing the \"A\" press plaintext and then XORing the \"B\" press plaintext.  The packets can be substituted by switching the \"A\" press checksum with the \"B\" press checksum and replacing the cyphertext.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

A local user may be able to execute a 16-bit application that specifically has execute permissions denied.\nIt is reported that Microsoft Windows NT, 2000, and XP operating systems do not properly check execution rights before allowing 16-bit executables to load.\n\nWhen a 16-bit file is loaded, it is usually opened first by the NT loader, which checks the execute permissions and also detects that the file is a 16-bit process and passes it to the NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) process.  The NTVDM process will then load the 16-bit application for execution. However, a 16-bit executable file can apparently be loaded directly by NTVDM without ever being sent to the loader when loaded by another 16-bit program.\n\nFor example, the following command line will reportedly run the '16BitApp.exe' application regardless of its execute permissions:\n\nCOMMAND /c 16BitApp.exe\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nhttp://www.abtrusion.com/msexe16.asp",

    "Description": "An access control and authentication vulnerability was reported in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), used by various Windows applications.  A remote user with access to the encrypted data stream may determine information about the unencrypted data and can modify the stream without detection.\nIt is reported that RDP leaks information about the contents of encrypted packets due to a weakness in computing the checksums, as packets with the same plaintext have matching checksums.  All versions of Windows using encrypted RDP are apparently affected.\n\nIn RDP 5.0, some common commands, including user input events, can reportedly be sent via special packets where only the key code and key event type (press, repeat, or release) is transmitted.   In this case, a timestamp is not sent.  As a result, the packet checksum is the same for each key event type for the same key.  A remote user monitoring the encrypted packet stream can therefore determine when the same key has been pressed, even though the key itself is not disclosed.  By monitoring a large amount of session data and performing an analysis of key patterns and frequencies within the session, a remote user could determine the actual keys pressed by the victim.  This could be used to capture passwords.\n\nAlso, it is reported that RDP version 5.0 allows a remote user with access to the encrypted data stream to manipulate keystrokes sent via the network.\n\nAccording to the report, if the victim presses \"A\" and the remote user wants to modify this to be a \"B\" key press, the remote user can obtain the desired cyphertext by XORing the \"A\" press plaintext and then XORing the \"B\" press plaintext.  The packets can be substituted by switching the \"A\" press checksum with the \"B\" press checksum and replacing the cyphertext.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in Microsoft's secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol implementation.  A remote user with access to a target user's encrypted data stream could conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain the unencrypted data.\nThe vulnerability reportedly exists in the way in which Internet Explorer (IE) follows certificate chains.  A browser should verify that the CN field of the certificate matches the server's domain, that it is signed by the intermediate certificate authority (CA), and that the intermediate CA's certificate is signed by a known CA.  According to the report, the browser should also check that all intermediate certificates have valid CA Basic Constraints.\n\nIt is reported that IE does not check the Basic Constraints.  As a result, a server with a valid certificate (signed by a valid CA) for any domain can apparently generate a valid CA-signed certificate for any other domain (from the perspective of the IE browser, that is).\n\nTo exploit this, the remote user must generate a valid certificate for a domain within the user's administrative control and obtain a valid signature from a known CA (e.g., VeriSign).  Then, the remote user can generate a certificate for an arbitrary domain and sign it with their own CA.\n\nBecause IE does not check the Basic Constraints on the certificate for the arbitrary domain, IE will reportedly accept this certificate chain as valid for the arbitrary domain.  \n\nA remote user can thus spoof any domain using a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nIt is reported that there will be no browser warnings presented to the target user.  However, if the target user chooses to view the certificate of the intended web site, the target user will see the attacker's certificate in the chain.\n\nIt is also reported that IE 6 may not follow the chain in certain cases, depending on what content the valid CA places in the Basic Constraint field.\n\n[Editor's note: In November 2002, Microsoft reported that there is a closely related variant (CVE: CVE-2002-1183) to this vulnerability relating to certificate validation.  However, the new vulnerability may allow a remote user to gain control over the target user's system.  Only Microsoft Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition are affected by this new variant, the vendor reported.  The vendor did not provide details of this new variant.]",

The length of certain value is not properly checked, allowing a local user to exploit the buffer overflow.\n\nA local user could modify a phonebook entry using specially crafted, malformed data so that, when the user makes a connection using the modified phonebook entry, arbitrary user-supplied code will be executed.  The local user could also cause the RAS service or the server itself to crash.",

A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges.\nMicrosoft reports that there is a flaw in the debugging facility's authentication mechanism that allows a local user to gain access to the debugger.  Normally, when a user invokes the debugger to attach to another program, the Windows debugger ensures that the debugger has the appropriate privileges.

As a result, a local user's unprivileged program could attach to the debugger without having the required privileges.\n\nThe local user can exploit the debugger to cause a currently running program to run arbitrary code.  Because many programs run as part of the operating system (with SYSTEM level privileges), the local user can connect to one of these privileged programs and command that program to run arbitrary code as the operating system itself.

It is reported that if one Windows application places an exclusive lock on a file, no other application can access the file even if the other application does not want to lock the file. \n\nAccording to Microsoft, Group Policy in Windows 2000 is implemented by storing data in the Active Directory and the system volume on the domain controller. This storage location is called the Group Policy Object (GPO). When a host or user logs onto the domain, it reads the GPO and all applicable settings within the GPO.\n\nA local user can prevent Group Policy from being applied for all users affected by the Group Policy Object (GPO).

A local user can obtain handles to any process or thread and can obtain administrator privileges on the system.\nIt is reported that the Windows Session Manager (smss.exe) contains a feature that allows a local user with 'Everyone' user privileges to get a handle to any process or thread.  If the target process is running with LocalSystem or Administrator privileges, the handle will apparently have enough access to promote the user to System or Administrator levels.\n\nA local user can reportedly request that the debugging subsystem within the Session Manager create (or duplicate) one or more handle to the target process using the following steps:\n\n1. Become dbgss client using the bgUiConnectToDbg API.\n\n2. Connect to DbgSsApiPort LPC port (ZwConnectPort).  Everyone has access to this port, according to the report.\n\n3. Ask dbgss to handle CreateProcess SsApi with client id (or pid or tid only) of target (ZwRequestPort).\n\n4. Wait for dbgss to reply with CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT (WaitForDebugEvent). Message contains duplicated handle(s).\n\n5. When debugger's thread terminates (e.g. on logoff), the target process or thread is terminated (as if it was regularly debugged).\n\nFor the exploit code and a fix provided by the author, see:\n\nhttp://www.anticracking.sk/EliCZ/bugs/DebPloit.zip\n\nIt is reported that Windows XP is not affected.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

A remote user could create HTML code to exploit the vulnerability on another user's system under certain very specific situations, causing arbitrary code to be executed on the target (victim) user's host.\nAn unchecked buffer reportedly exists in the Windows Shell (Windows Desktop) in one of the functions that helps to locate incompletely removed applications on the system.  A local user could reportedly trigger the buffer overflow and cause arbitrary code to be executed in the security context of the local user.  By itself, this may not represent a risk.  However, Microsoft indicates that under 'very unusual conditions', this vulnerability could be exploited via a web page.\n\nIf the local user has installed and then uninstalled an application with custom URL handlers and if the application's uninstall routine failed to correctly remove the application completely, an exploit may be possible.  When an application is installed, the Windows Shell allows the application to register a new URL type as a custom URL handler to allow a specific URL to cause the application to execute.  For example, Outlook 20002 registers \"outlook://\" as a custom URL handler.  If the uninstall routine does not remove a URL handler, the exploit may be possible.  A remote user could create an HTML web page or HTML-based e-mail message that could exploit the 'orphaned' URL handler and overrun the buffer.\n\nThe buffer overflow reportedly exists in a part of the Windows Shell that helps to locate programs when they have been incompletely removed. The affected function is apparently invoked only when the Shell can locate a custom URL handler but not its associated application.",

A user who is a valid administrator on a trusted domain can reportedly insert SIDs of his choice into the domain controller's authorization data to obtain the privileges associated with a user in another domain that trusts his domain.\n\nAs reported by Microsoft, when a user in a trusted domain requests access to a resource in a different trusting domain (where the \"trusting\" domain trusts the \"trusted\" domain), the trusted domain will supply a list of SIDs that represent authorization data regarding the the user's identity and group memberships.  This information is used by the trusting domain to determine whether to grant the user's request for resource access.\n\nIt is reported that the trusting domain does not verify that the trusted domain is a valid authority for all of the SIDs listed in the authorization data.  So, a user who is an administrator on a trusted domain can add a SID to his domain controller for a user or security group not in that domain, and the trusting domain will accept the data as valid.\n\nMicrosoft notes that this is a difficult exploit that requires technical knowledge to create and install operating system level code to inject the SIDs -- there is apparently no easy mechanism for an administrator to inject false SIDs.",

For the full list, see the Vendor URL.\n\nMicrosoft has issued warnings regarding the mechanism designed to fix this vulnerability.  Please read the vendor's advisory carefully.  In summary, \"SID Filtering\" can be installed on a \"trusting\" domain controller and configured for a specific trusted domain.  When this occurs, the trusting domain will apparently check all incoming SIDs from the specified trusted domain and will remove any SIDs that don t belong to the trusted domain.  Note that SID Filtering is *not* enabled by default with the patch.\n\nFor details on enabling and configuring SID Filtering (using a registry entry), see Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q289243.\n\nIt is reported that SID Filtering may screen out legitimate SIDs in certain cases (described in the vendor advisory), so this option should be carefully considered in advance of implementation.",

The security hole may allow a remote user to change any other user's domain login password, including that of a domain administrator.\nThe LDAP via SSL function reportedly contains a vulnerability that can be triggered only when the directory principal is a domain user and the LDAP data attribute is the domain password.  In this case, the function fails to properly check the permissions of the user making the LDAP request.\n\nIf a remote user exploits this vulnerability to change the password of a domain administrator, the remote user can gain administrative control of the domain server.\n\nThe vendor notes that the affected function can be accessed by any remote user that can connect to the LDAP server (including access via anonymous sessions).\n\nBecause LDAP over SSL sessions cannot be conducted unless the administrator has installed a digital certificate on the LDAP server, default installations of Windows  2000 are not affected by this vulnerability.",

The author states that no exploitable buffer overflows have been found so far.\n\nThe author provided the following demonstration code:\n\n------------InstantCrash.html-----------------\n<iframe id=test style=\"display:none\"></iframe>\n<script>\nLarholm = {}; // Object literal\ntest.document.open(); // Stream data\ntest.document.write(\"<s\"+\"cript>top.Larholm.test=0</s\"+\"cript>\");\ndelete Larholm;\nLarholm = {}; // Crash\n</script>\n----------------------------------------------",
    "Impact'": "Malicious HTML code could cause the HTML application to crash.",
    "Solution": "As a workaround, you can disable active scripting.  Vendor will fix in an upcoming service pack for Internet Explorer.",
