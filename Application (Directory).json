A remote user can bypass security controls on the target system. A remote user can obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks. Oracle Directory Server Enterprise is affected.\nA remote user can create specially crafted content that, when loaded by the target user, will trigger a memory corruption error and execute arbitrary code on the target user's system [CVE-2015-4513, CVE-2015-4514].\n\nA remote user can submit an NTLM request (via HTTP) to determine the hostname and potentially the Windows domain of the target system [CVE-2015-4515]\n\nThe Reader View does not properly disable script code in SVG animations in certain cases [CVE-2015-4518]. A remote user can bypass Reader mode security protections to potentially cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from an arbitrary site and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nOn Firefox for Android, the system may not restore the address bar when exiting fullscreen mode. A remote user may be able to exploit this to spoof the addressbar [CVE-2015-7185].\n\nOn Firefox for Android, an application may be able to invoke \"file://\" URIs to download additional files or open cached profile data [CVE-2015-7186].\n\nWhen a panel is created using the Add-on SDK in a browser extension with the \"script: false\" setting, the system may not disable the execution of inline script [CVE-2015-7187].\n\nA user can append white-space characters to hostnames that are IP addresses to bypass same-origin policy and potentially conduct cross-site scripting attacks [CVE-2015-7188].\n\nA remote user can trigger a buffer overflow in the JPEGEncoder function during script interactions with a canvas element and potentially execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7189].\n\nOn Firefox for Android, a remote user may be able to exploit a flaw in the Search feature to load a URL with system privileges and read arbitrary files on the target system [CVE-2015-7190].\n\nOn Firefox for Android, a remote user can exploit Android intents and fallback navigation to conduct cross-site scripting attacks [CVE-2015-7191].\n\nOn OS X systems, a remote user may be able to trigger an error when an accessibility tool requests the index of a table row through the NSAccessibilityIndexAttribute value and execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7192].\n\nA remote user can trigger an error in the processing of cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) \"preflight\" requests to bypass same-origin policy [CVE-2015-7193].\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted ZIP file that, when processed by the target user, will trigger a buffer underflow in libjar (libxul) and potentially execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7194].\n\nA remote user may be able to create a URL with certain escaped characters in the hostname to trigger a parsing error and potentially access site-specific tokens [CVE-2015-7195].\n\nA remote user can cause the Java plugin to deallocate a JavaScript wrapper when it is still in use, leading to a JavaScript garbage collection crash and potentially to code execution [CVE-2015-7196]. Systems with Java installed an enabled as a browser plugin are affected.\n\nSome flaws exist in the ANGLE graphics library, in SVG rendering, and in cryptographic key manipulation that could potentially execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7198, CVE-2015-7199, CVE-2015-7200]. A method to trigger these flaws has not been identified.\n\nA web worker can bypass mixed content policy for WebSockets when workers are used to create WebSockets [CVE-2015-7197].\n\nA remote user can trigger a buffer overflow in the ASN.1 decoder in Network Security Services (NSS) to execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7181, CVE-2015-7182, CVE-2015-7183].\n\nChristian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong, Andrew McCreight, Georg Fritzsche, Tyson Smith, Carsten Book, Tim Brown, Mario Heiderich, Frederik Braun, \nJordi Chancel, Jason Hamilton and Peter Arremann with AMO editor Sylvain Giroux, Michal Bentkowski, Looben Yang, Muneaki Nishimura, Frederic Wang, Shinto K Anto, \nGustavo Grieco, Frans Rosen, Vytautas Staraitis, Ronald Crane, Ehsan Akhgari, David Keeler, and Ryan Sleevi reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in the ASN.1 parsing code in OpenSSL. A remote user may be able to cause arbitrary code to be executed on a server application that uses OpenSSL.  Novell eDirectory is available.\nIt is reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted SSL client certificate containing invalid ASN.1 tag values to trigger a flaw in OpenSSL and cause OpenSSL to crash due to \"out of bounds reads\" (CVE: CVE-2003-0543 and CVE-2003-0544).  These flaws affected 0.9.6 and 0.9.7.  The specific impact depends on the application using OpenSSL.  The report indicates that the effects against Apache (when using OpenSSL) are \"limited\" and only cause Apache httpd child processes to crash.\n\nIt is also reported that certain ASN.1 encodings detected to be invalid may trigger a double free of the ASN1_TYPE variable, deallocating memory that has already been deallocated (CVE: CVE-2003-0545).  This flaw only affects 0.9.7.  A remote user may be able to send a specially crafted SSL client certificate to an application that uses OpenSSL to potentially execute arbitrary code.  The exact impact depends on how the application uses OpenSSL.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can specify an invalid public key in a certificate to cause the verify code to crash if the target server is configured to ignore public key decoding errors.  The vendor notes that ignoring public key decoding errors is usually only done in debugging situations and not usually in production code.  [Editor's note:  A CVE number had not yet been assigned to this issue at the time of this entry.]\n\nNISCC is credited with discovering these vulnerabilities.\n\nThe vendor reports a fourth related security issue, where an error in the SSL/TLS protocol handling will cause a server to parse a client certificate even when a client certificate is not specifically requested.  As a result, any server application that uses OpenSSL can be attacked using the vulnerabilities described above, even if the server application does not enable client authentication.",

    "Description": "A potential denial of service vulnerability was reported in Microsoft's Active Directory.  A remote user may be able to cause Active Directory to hang under certain circumstances.  If anonymous queries are disabled, the remote user must be authenticated.\nIt is reported that a remote user that has authenticated to the Windows 2000 Realm using Kerberos V may be able to query a Microsoft Active Directory server via LDAP in such a manner that the directory will hang.  \n\nThe author indicates that the vulnerability may exist in the GSSAPI layer and not in Active Directory itself.\n\nThe vulnerability was reportedly triggered with a paged search conducted using the OpenLDAP 2.0.23 ldapsearch tool compiled with GSSAPI support to allow Kerberos V authentication.  For information on conducting paged searches, see:\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/netdir/ldap/paging_search_results.asp\n\nIn a manner reportedly consistent with RFC 2696, the author added the following lines of code to the ldapsearch tool:\n\n---------------------------------------\nLDAPControl c;\nLDAPControl *ctrls[2];\nctrls[0] = &c;\nctrls[1] = NULL;\n\nc.ldctl_oid = \"1.2.840.113556.1.4.319\";\nc.ldctl_value.bv_val = NULL;\nc.ldctl_value.bv_len = 0;\nc.ldctl_iscritical = 0;\n\nldap_set_option(ld,LDAP_OPT_SERVER_CONTROLS,ctrls);\n----------------------------------------\n\nAs a test case, the directory was passed a page length of 0, causing the directory to hang.\n\nThe author notes that if anonymous queries are DISABLED, the flaw can only be triggered by a remote authenticated user.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",
