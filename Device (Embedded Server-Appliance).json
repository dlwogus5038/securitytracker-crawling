Juniper Junos Space is affected.\nA local user can exploit race conditions in CPU data cache processing to obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",

A local user can read arbitrary virtual memory on the target CPU device.\nA local user can exploit race conditions in CPU data cache processing to obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs. A local user can read arbitrary virtual memory on the target CPU device.\nA local user can exploit race conditions in CPU data cache processing to obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",
    "Impact'": "A local user can view arbitrary virtual memory contents on the target CPU device [which can lead to elevated privileges on the target system].",
    "Solution": "The CPU vendors are providing software and firmware updates to mitigate the applicable vulnerabilities to operating system vendors and system manufacturers.\n\n[Editor's note: Various operating system and application vendors are implementing software solutions to mitigate these CPU vulnerabilities.

A remote user can also determine valid filenames, conduct port scans, and conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nA remote user can set the 'proxystylesheet' parameter to point to a remote XSLT style sheet.  The appliance does not properly validate the user-supplied input in this parameter, which creates several vulnerabilities.\n\nThe appliance does not filter HTML code from user-supplied input before displaying the input.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser.  The code will originate from the appliance and will run in the security context of the appliance.  As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the appliance, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the appliance, or take actions on the appliance acting as the target user.\n\nThis can be achieved by including javascript in the parameter value or by including javascript in an XSLT style sheet and specifying the style sheet's location via the parameter.\n\nA remote user can supply a relative path to determine if a specified file exists on the target system.  The error message returned by the appliance will indicate whether or not the path was valid.\n\nA remote user can supply a URL with a port number to cause the appliance to attempt to connect to the target URL/port number.  The error message returned by the appliance will differ depending on whether the port is open or closed.  This can be exploited to cause the appliance to scan ports on a system that may not otherwise be accessible to the remote user.\n\nA remote user can create a malicious XSLT style sheet containing arbitrary Java class methods and then have the appliance execute those methods.  As a result, a remote user can execute arbitrary system commands on the target system.\n\nH D Moore discovered this vulnerability.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://metasploit.com/research/vulns/google_proxystylesheet/",

Multiple vendors are affected.  Blue Coat's ProxySG operating system (SGOS) is affected.\nThe UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre (NISCC) reported that some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are particularly vulnerable to TCP reset attacks.  A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities.  Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\".  In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated.  Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said.  However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number.

If the server is configured for challenge response authentication *and* the system is using SKEY or BSD_AUTH authentication, the system may be vulnerable.  A remote user can send a specially-crafted reply to cause the daemon to crash or to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.  This flaw is reported to be present in version 2.9.9 through 3.3.\n\nThe other vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the processing of the number of responses received during challenge response authentication.

    "Description": "Sun reported a vulnerability in their Sun Ray appliance when used with Non-Smartcard Mobility (NSCM).  A remote user may be able to gain access to a Sun Ray user account.\nA remote user may be able to use 'dtlogin' to login to a Sun Ray server that is configured to use non-smartcard mobility (NSCM) and 'inadvertently' gain access as a different user.  The remote user must be using a client that is issuing XDMCP to the Sun Ray server inorder for the exploit to work.  The remote user apparently is not required to have their own account on the Sun Ray server itself. \n\nSun reports that Sun Ray Server Software (SRSS) 1.3 with CDE patch 108919-14 (for Solaris 8) and without patch 111891-05 is affected.  According to the report, SRSS 1.2 and earlier are not affected. \n\nTo determine if a Sun Ray server is configured to use NSCM, Sun suggests running the following command and then viewing the output:\n\n\t$ /opt/SUNWut/sbin/utpolicy\n\t# Reading policy file: /etc/opt/SUNWut/policy/utpolicy\n\t# Current Policy:\n\t/opt/SUNWut/sbin/utpolicy -a -m -M -g -z both                                          \n\nIf the \"-M\" switch is present in the Current Policy display, the Sun Ray server is indeed running NSCM and could potentially be vulnerable.",

A remote user can download the \"chip.ini\" file, which contains all usernames and paswords by using the following URL:  http://[targethost]/chip.ini\n\nIf a lengthy request is sent to the web server, the server will stop responding for a few moments.\n\nA CGI script called \"ChipCfg\", which is installed by deafult and cannot be removed, discloses network data to any remote user using the following URL:  http://[targethost]/ChipCfg\n\nThe server can reportedly accommodate only 64 socket connections, so it can be subjected to a denial of service attack with relative ease.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can obtain usernames and passwords from the web server or readily guess user names and passwords on the telnet server, can cause the web server to momentarily stop processing, and can cause the server to become overloaded.",
    "Solution": "No solution was available at the time of this entry.  The author of the report provides some suggested work arounds (see the Source Message for details).",
