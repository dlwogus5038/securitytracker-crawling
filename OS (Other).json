The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754].

    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in OpenSSL. A remote user can decrypt TLS sessions in certain cases. A remote user can cause denial of service conditions on the target system. HPE NonStop Virtual TapeServer is affected.\nA remote user can decrypt TLS sessions in certain cases by using a server that supports SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle [CVE-2016-0800]. This attack is known as a DROWN attack.\n\nSystems with a private key used on another server for any protocol that allows SSLv2 connections are affected.\n\nSystems running versions prior to 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r, and 0.9.8zf (released on March 19, 2015) can be exploited more readily.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttps://drownattack.com/drown-attack-paper.pdf\n\nNimrod Aviram, Sebastian Schinzel, Juraj Somorovsky, Nadia Heninger, Maik Dankel, Jens Steube, Luke Valenta, David Adrian, J. Alex Halderman, Viktor Dukhovni, Emilia Kasper, Shaanan Cohney, Susanne Engels, Christof Paar, and Yuval Shavitt reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted private DSA key that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a double free memory error and cause denial of service conditions [CVE-2016-0705].\n\nAdam Langley (Google/BoringSSL) reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can supply a specially crafted username value to the target SRP server to trigger a memory leak [CVE-2016-0798].\n\nEmilia Kasper of the OpenSSL development team reported this vulnerability.\n\nA user can create specially crafted data (e.g., configuration file) that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a null pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() functions [CVE-2016-0797].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.\n\nA user can create specially crafted data that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a memory error in BIO_*printf() functions [CVE-2016-0799].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.\n\nA local user can conduct a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture to potentially recover RSA keys [CVE-2016-0702].\n\nYuval Yarom, the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin, Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger, University of Pennsylvania, reported this vulnerability.\n\nThe SSLv2 's2_srvr.c' code does not ensure that a clear-key-length value is 0 for non-export ciphers. As a result, clear-key bytes can displace encrypted-key bytes, which can be exploited to conduct a key recovery attack [CVE-2016-0703].\n\nVersions 1.0.2, 1.0.1l, 1.0.0q, and 0.9.8ze and prior versions are affected.\n\nDavid Adrian and J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan reported this vulnerability.\n\nThe Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites in 's2_srvr.c' overwrites bytes incorrectly in the master-key, which may provide a Bleichenbacher oracle that can be used to decrypt sessions [CVE-2016-0704].\n\nVersions 1.0.2, 1.0.1l, 1.0.0q, and 0.9.8ze and all prior versions are affected.\n\nDavid Adrian and J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can trigger an out-of-bounds memory write error in doapr_outch() in 'crypto/bio/b_print.c' to potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system [CVE-2016-2842].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.",

OpenSSL clients and servers are not affected. Michal Zalewski of Google and Emilia Kasper of the OpenSSL development team reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user may be able to trigger a flaw in the 'multiblock' code on 64-bit x86 systems that support AES NI instructions and cause the target system to potentially crash [CVE-2015-0290]. Only version 1.0.2 is affected. Daniel Danner and Rainer Mueller reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can renegotiate with an invalid signature algorithm extension to trigger a null pointer dereference and cause the target service to crash [CVE-2015-0291]. Only version 1.0.2 is affected. David Ramos (@ramosbugs) of Stanford University reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can send base64 encoded data to trigger a flaw in OpenSSL and cause the target application or service to crash [CVE-2015-0292].

JDK/JRE 1.1.8, 1.2.2 and JDK/JRE 1.3.0 based releases are available at: \nhttp://www.hp.com/go/java\n\nThe vulnerability is fixed in releases 1.3.1 and higher.  Users of 1.3.0.x will need to update to 1.3.1.\n\nThe releases described in HP Security Bulletin #0186, issued 4 March 2002, also correct the vulnerability described here.  In other words, the releases in Section C. below will correct both vulnerabilities, according to HP.\n\nObtain one of the following releases:\n\n         JDK and JRE 1.1.8.06 or higher for HP-UX 10.20 or 11.x.\n         JDK and JRE 1.2.2.12 or higher for HP-UX 11.x.\n         JDK and JRE 1.3.1.00 or higher for HP-UX 11.x\n\nTo determining the Java version information for JDK, JRE, and JPI:\n\nThere are two mechanisms to determine which versions of the Java JDK/SDK (developer kit), JRE (runtime), or JPI (Java Plugin for Netscape) you have installed.\n\nFirst, you can use the following command to list the bundle revisions for any installed Java products:\n\n      /usr/sbin/swlist -l bundle | grep -i java\n\nSecond, you can ask Java to identify itself by executing the following:\n\n      <path>/bin/java -version\n           where path is typically\n\n      /opt/java - for Java 1.1\n      /opt/java1.2 - for Java 1.2\n      /opt/java1.3 - for Java 1.3\n\nbut may be an alternate location as specified during setup.\n\nThe plugin (JPI) is installed in user's home directories, so you will need to check its version using the following.\n\nFor Java 1.2:\n\n      $HOME/.netscape/java/bin/java -version\n\nFor Java 1.1, you must use:\n\n      what $HOME/.netscape/java/bin/PA_RISC/green_threads/jre\n\nNOTE: Do not rely on Netscape's Help/About_Plug-ins menu to find the version number of the Plugin, because in some cases the version number is incorrect.\n\na.) Unplugging the Plugin (Since the Plugin is manually installed into Netscape, it must be manually removed as well.)\n\nIf you have a plugin that you wish to remove because it has a security issue, in addition to doing a swremove of the product you must also do the following for Java 1.1 and Java 1.2:\n\n    rm -f $HOME/.netscape/plugins/javaplugin.sl\n    rm -rf $HOME/.netscape/java",

    "Date": "Jul 13 2001",
    "Impact": "Denial of service via network",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in several operating systems that allows remote users to cause the host to transmit a significantly higher number of packets and consume increased CPU resources to do so, creating a potential denial of service condition. \nIn the TCP protocol, the initiating host specifies a Maximum Segment Size (MSS) value to request that the remote host send an amount of TCP data no larger than the MSS value in any single IP packet. The purpose is presumably to indicate the largest TCP segment that, if fragmented during transmission, can be reassembled by the initiating host.\n\nThe reported minimums are listed below for several operating systems:\n\nNetBSD = 32, \nFreeBSD = 64,\nOpenBSD = 64,\nLinux 2.4 = 88,\nWin2000 = 88.\n\nThe lower the value, the more overhead is required by the remote host, both in number of packets transmitted (with large headers and a small payload) and in CPU resources consumed to participate in the TCP protocol.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can potentially impact host performance by setting a low MSS value and then requesting a large amount of data. This will result in the remote host transmitting a higher number of packets and TCP overhead than would normally be sent and may result in increased CPU resources to do this.",
