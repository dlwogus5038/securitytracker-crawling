Microsoft SQL Server is affected.\nA local user can exploit race conditions in CPU data cache processing to obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",

A remote authenticated user can obtain passwords on the target system. A remote user can gain access to the target system.\nBecause libpq and libpq-based connection drivers do not send empty password values to the server during an authentication attempt, setting a target user's password to an empty value effectively disables password authentication for the target user's account when using those specific connection drivers. However, other connection drivers that are not based on libpq may forward an empty password, allowing a remote user to supply an empty password to access the target user's account for accounts that have set an empty password value [CVE-2017-7546].\n\nA remote authenticated user can exploit a flaw in the the foreign data wrapper functionality to view passwords in the pg_user_mappings catalog view [CVE-2017-7547].\n\nA remote authenticated user can exploit an access control flaw in the lo_put() function to change the data in a large object and cause denial of service conditions [CVE-2017-7548].\n\nChapman Flack, Jeff Janes, Ben de Graaff, Jelte Fennema, and Jeroen van der Ham reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in Samba. A remote user can cause denial of service conditions on the target system. A remote user can hijack connection. A remote user can obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. IBM DB2 is affected.\nA remote authenticated user can exploit a missing error check in dcesrv_auth_bind_ack() in the DCE/RPC protocol implementation to cause excessive CPU consumption on the target system or cause the target service to crash or execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-5370]. Versions 3.6.0 to 4.4.0 are affected.\n\nThe NTLMSSP implementation is not protected against downgrading. A remote user that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack can hijack the target connection [CVE-2016-2110].\n\nThe NTLMSSP implementation is not protected against downgrading. A remote user that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack can spoof a system name to a Domain Controller and obtain session-related information about the spoofed system [CVE-2016-2111].\n\nThe LDAP implementation does not enforce integrity protection for LDAP connections. A remote user that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack can downgrade the target LDAP connection to use no integrity protection and gain access to the connection [CVE-2016-2112].\n\nA remote user that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack can gain access to LDAP connection [CVE-2016-2113]. Versions 4.0.0 to 4.4.0 are affected.\n\nThe system does not enforce the mandatory server signing configuration setting. As a result, a remote user can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to hijack SMB1 connections [CVE-2016-2114]. Versions 4.0.0 to 4.4.0 are affected.\n\nThe IPC implementation does not enforce integrity protection by default. A remote user that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attacker can view and modify data sent via the IPC connection [CVE-2016-2115].\n\nA remote user that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against DCE/RPE connections can impersonate the target user against the Security Account Manager Remote Protocol (MS-SAMR) and the Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol (MS-LSAD) implementations to obtain read/write access to the target Security Account Manager database [CVE-2016-2118]. This can be exploited to obtain passwords in the database. Versions 3.6.0 to 4.4.0 are affected.\n\n[Editor's note: Microsoft Windows is also affected by this vulnerability, as described in CVE-2016-0128 (Alert ID 1035534). This vulnerability is known as \"Badlock\".]\n\nJouni Knuutinen of Synopsys reported the dcesrv_auth_bind_ack() vulnerability.

    "Description": "Two vulnerabilities were reported in MySQL.  A remote authenticated user can execute arbitrary code on the target system and can obtain information from the MySQL service.\nA remote authenticated user can send specially crafted COM_TABLE_DUMP packets to trigger a stack overflow and execute arbitrary code on the target system.  The code will run with the privileges of the target user.\n\n5.0.20 and prior 5.0 versions and possibly other versions are affected by the stack overflow vulnerability.\n\nA remote authenticated user can also send specially crafted data to the target system to read random memory from the target server.  This may allow the remote authenticated user to obtaion portions queries and or responses pertaining to a previous user.\n\nThe vendor was notified on April 25, 2006.\n\n5.0.20 and prior 5.0 versions, 4.0.26 and prior 4.0 versions; 4.1.18 and prior 4.1 versions are affected by the information disclosure vulnerability.\n\nStefano Di Paola reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in MySQL in the use of temporary files with the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE function.  A local user with database access privileges may be able to gain elevated privileges within the database.\nThe function uses a predictable filename when creating temporary files for use by temporary tables.\n\nA local user can create a symbolic link (symlink) from another database file on the system to a temporary file to be used by MySQL.  Then, the local user can authenticate to the database and create a temporary table (that will use the symlinked file).  The authenticated user may then be able to gain elevated privileges within the database application.\n\nStefano Di Paola of wisec.it reported this vulnerability.",
    "Impact'": "A local user with database access privileges may be able to gain elevated privileges within the database.",

A local user with database access privileges may be able to gain elevated privileges within the database.\nThe function uses a predictable filename when creating temporary files for use by temporary tables.\n\nA local user can create a symbolic link (symlink) from another database file on the system to a temporary file to be used by MySQL.  Then, the local user can authenticate to the database and create a temporary table (that will use the symlinked file).  The authenticated user may then be able to gain elevated privileges within the database application.\n\nStefano Di Paola of wisec.it reported this vulnerability.",

A local user can overwrite files on the target system.\nShaun Colley reported that when a user runs 'mysqlbug' and then exits the text editor without modifying the bug report, a temporary file ('/tmp/failed-mysql-bugreport') is created in an unsafe manner.  A local user can create a symbolic link (symlink) from a critical file on the system to this temporary file.  Then, when the error condition is triggered by a target user, the symlinked file will be overwritten with the privileges of the target user.\n\nA local user may be able to gain elevated privileges on the target system.",

A remote user may be able to execute arbitrary code in some cases.\nChris Anley of NGSSoftware reported that a remote user can submit a specially crafted authentication packet to bypass the password authentication mechanims on MySQL.  The flaw reportedly resides in the check_scramble_323() function [CVE: CVE-2004-0627].\n\nA remote user can specify an arbitrary 'passwd_len' value to cause the function to compare a known 'scrambled' password value with a zero-length string.  The function reportedly allows a remote user to authenticate successfully with a zero-length string.\n\nIt is also reported that there is a stack-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by a long 'scramble' string generated by my_rnd() [CVE: CVE-2004-0628].

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in MySQL in the 'mysqlbug' component.  A local user can overwrite files on the target system.\nShaun Colley reported that when a user runs 'mysqlbug' and then exits the text editor without modifying the bug report, a temporary file ('/tmp/failed-mysql-bugreport') is created in an unsafe manner.  A local user can create a symbolic link (symlink) from a critical file on the system to this temporary file.  Then, when the error condition is triggered by a target user, the symlinked file will be overwritten with the privileges of the target user.\n\nA local user may be able to gain elevated privileges on the target system.",

On Linux-based systems, only the remote authenticated user's session will crash, the report said. However, a remote authenticated user can reportedly send a stream of connections to introduce denial of service conditions and prevent other clients from logging in.\n\nIt is reported that the remote authenticated user can specify invalid lengths for various components of the remote password array in the TDS LOGINREC structure to trigger a heap overflow.  The report indicates that the potential of remote code execution is unlikely but has not been ruled out.\n\nIt is reported that Sybase 11.0.3.3 for Linux appears to be unaffected.",

The vendor was reportedly notified on February 5, 2003.\n\nIn another vulnerability, a local user may be able to hijack a named pipe to gain elevated privileges (CVE-2003-0230).  The vulnerability is reportedly caused by a flaw in the method used to check for named pipes.  A local user may be able to gain the privileges of the user whose session created the named pipe.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted, large packet to a specific named pipe to cause the SQL Server to stop responding (CVE-2003-0231). The vendor was reportedly notified on January 28, 2003.",

This user account is optional, according to the advisory.  The utility reportedly can be made to execute arbitrary binaries with root privileges.\n\nA local user with 'uvadm' user privileges can also gain root privileges by exploiting a buffer overflow in the uvadmsh binary.

A remote user could execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the database service. A remote user could also cause system performance to be degraded.  It is reported that a worm is actively infecting unpatched systems.\nA remote user can reportedly send a specially crafted packet to the SQL Server 2000 Resolution Service on UDP port 1434 to trigger one of two overflows, a heap overflow or a stack overflow. This could cause the SQL Server service to crash, or it could cause arbitrary code to be executed in the security context of the SQL Server service. By default, this service runs as a Domain User. \n\nA remote user also could trigger a packet storm between two servers by sending a spoofed keep-alive packet to the Resolution Service. As a result, the target SQL Server 2000 will respond with the same information. If the original packet was crafted to appear to have originated from another SQL Server 2000 system, the two systems could reportedly enter a never-ending cycle of keep-alive packet exchanges, causing excessive resources to be consumed on both systems. \n\nAccording to several reports (including the eEye Digital Security analysis contained in the Source Message), a worm is circulating the Internet, infecting hosts that have not been patched.  The worm apparently spreads rapidly via port 1434.  In some cases, the traffic generated by the worm may cause denial of service conditions on networks with infected hosts.\n\nMicrosoft credits David Litchfield of Next Generation Security Software Ltd. for reporting these issues.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in MySQL.  A remote user could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.  A remote user with a valid database account could gain access to other accounts on the database.\ne-matters reported that two bugs in the MySQL server allow a remote authenticated user to cause the server to crash.  One of those bugs may also allow a remote user to bypass the password authentication process or execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the 'mysqld' process.\n\nAn unsigned integer vulnerability was reported in the server.  When processing the COM_TABLE_DUMP package, two characters are convertd to unsigned integers.  If the characters are negative, the interger conversion process will result in a large unsigned number.  The report states that this can probably only be exploited to cause a denial of service condition, as it is a heap-to-heap copy operation and there is no memory allocating function within the SIGSEGV handler.\n\nAn authentication vulnerability in the COM_CHANGE_USER command was reported.  This flaw is a previously disclosed bug that was only partially corrected.  A client can send a one character response as part of the challenge-response transaction to cause the server to create a one-character expected response.  A remote client can reportedly guess the correct response in 32 attempts or less, as the allowable character set is only 32 characters.\n\nA remote user with a valid MySQL account can access other user accounts.  A local user could exploit this to gain access to the mysql root account and access, modify, or delete the database.\n\nAccording to the report, a remote user can send a longer than expected response to trigger a stack overflow and overwrite the saved instruction pointer with data generated by the password verification algorithm's random number generator.\n\nOn the client side, a heap overflow vulnerability was reported in the mysaql client library.  This can be triggered via a SELECT query statement (or other statements).  This could allow a user to execute arbitrary code on an application that is linked against libmysqlclient.\n\nA read_one_row byte overwrite vulnerability was also reported in libmysqlclient.  When the client library fetches one row from the server, field sizes are not verified against the defined boundaries.  A specially crafted malicious packet can supply an arbitrary field size to overwrite an arbitrary memory addresses with a '\\0' null terminator.  This could allow a remote user (with control of a database server) to execute arbitrary code on the system, or to crash the client.\n\nFor the original e-matters advisory, see:\n\nhttp://security.e-matters.de/advisories/042002.html",

According to the report, MySQL runs as an NT Service by default, yielding SYSTEM level privileges.\n\nA local user can modify the 'my.ini' file to contain a long string for the 'datadir' parameter to trigger a buffer overflow in mysqld-nt.exe and overwrite the EIP register.  This can cause arbitrary code to be executed.\n\nOn some systems, the configuration file may be located in the 'C:\\' directory and local users in the Everyone' group can modify the file.  On other systems, the file may be located in 'C:\\winnt\\', where the access controls are more restrictive.\n\nA demonstration exploit value is provided:\n\ndatadir=C:/AAAAAA...AAAA",

A remote user could create HTML that, when loaded, will cause the FoxPro application to launch and execute arbitrary code on the target user's system.\nMicrosoft reports that Visual FoxPro 6.0 fails to perform registration with Internet Explorer (IE).  So, when a target user loads HTML that references a Visual FoxPro application (a '.app' file), it is possible that the typical warning dialog process that IE presents to the target user may be bypassed and the FoxPro application could be started.  If a remote user creates a specially crafted filename for the '.app' file, FoxPro may start and execute the application.  This is apparently due to a flaw in the way Visual FoxPro 6.0 evaluates application filenames.\n\nA malicious application could query FoxPro databases and issue operating system commands in the security context of the target user.\n\nA target user is reportedly to be vulnerable only is Visual FoxPro application or the runtime version of Visual FoxPro is installed.  Note that some third-party products may install the Visual FoxPro 6.0 runtime.\n\nThe vendor indicats that you can determine whether the Visual FoxPro 6.0 runtime is present on your system by searching for any of the following files on your system: vfp6r.dll, vfp6t.dll, or vfp6run.exe.

A remote user could cause a denial of service condition via the Oracle Net Listener, and may be able to cause arbitrary code to be executed.\nIt is reported that a remote user can send a small amount of specially crafted data to the configured listening endpoint for Oracle Net Listener to cause the Oracle Net Listener to consume available CPU resources on the server.

It is not clear which bug this Oracle patch addresses, if any.  However Oracle has indicated that the patch is for a buffer overflow and that NGSSoftware discovered the bug.  It is important to note that both of the NGSSoftware reports imply that a remote user can execute arbitrary code on the system with these bugs.\n\nAlso note that in March 2002 we issued Alert #1003919 regarding a buffer overflow in the Oracle TNS Listener that could be triggered with a small packet and could cause the server to crash.  This description matches the conditions that Oracle describes in their advisory.  It is not clear if this Oracle patch addresses that vulnerability or not.\n\nIf we receive any clarifying information, we will update this alert accordingly.]",

    "Impact'": "A remote user can execute arbitrary system functions on the server with the privileges of the database server.",
    "Solution": "The vendor is reportedly working on a patch.\n\nNGSSoftware has provided some interim recommendations to mitigate risk:\n\n\"The first line of defense is, of course, with the use of a firewall. No one should be able to access the listener port of 1521 from the Internet. This not only helps mitigate the risk concerned with this problem but a slew of others, too.\n\nMoving to the Oracle database server itself, PLSExtproc functionality can be removed if not needed. To do this remove the relevant entries in tnsnames.ora and listener.ora. The PLS External Procedure service can have many different names depending upon the system and Oracle version installed.  This could be icache_extproc, PLSExtproc or extproc. It is also suggested that extproc(.exe) be deleted, too, on the off chance that an attacker, replaces the entries in tnsnames.ora and listener.ora.\n\nIf this functionality is required then it is possible to limit the machines that may access the listener. Whilst this is a trust mechanism based only on IP address it does help. The process is called \"valid node checking\" and requires a modification to the sqlnet.ora file found in the $ORACLE_HOME\\network\\admin directory. Add the entries\n\n tcp.validnode_checking = YES\n tcp.invited_nodes = (10.1.1.2, scylla)\n\nReplace 10.1.1.2 or Scylla in this example with the hosts that require access. Any host not listed here will still be able to make a TCP connection to the listener but the listener will simply terminate the connection.  Invited nodes should be restricted to machines that require access.\n\nAs another step towards help mitigating the risk, you could set the listener listening on a non-default port (i.e. not 1521). Whilst this is not a great solution, as anyone with a TCP port scanner has a highly likely chance of finding the listener, it still helps.\n\nFinally, on Windows NT/2000 the Oracle processes should not be running as local SYSTEM. It is suggested that a low privileged account be created and the Oracle processes run as this user. This account will need to be given the \"Logon as a service\" account privilege.\"",

There is apparently a SQL query method that contains a vulnerability that allows one user's query to re-use a previously terminated connection belonging to the system administrator account that still resides in the cache.\n\nThis vulnerability could allow a remote user to execute the query using the  administrator's security context, giving the remote user the ability to take any action on the database.  By running extended stored procedures, the remote user could execute arbitrary code on the server and obtain administrator-level privileges on the server (operating system).\n\nThe vulnerability reportedly can only be triggered if configured to use Mixed\nMode, which the vendor strongly recommends against, and if the user is authenticated.",

This can be used to gain additional access on the server.\nOne of the vendors writes to explain that the vulnerable version (3.20) is a very old version of MySQL and that the supported version is 3.23.x.  The vendor also notes that 3.23.1 (which was released more than a year ago) and the rest of the 3.23 branch does not contain this vulnerability.",
