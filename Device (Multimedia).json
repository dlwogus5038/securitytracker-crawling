    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs. A local user can read arbitrary virtual memory on the target CPU device. Apple TV is affected.\nA local user can exploit race conditions in CPU data cache processing to obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "Internet Security Systems reported several vulnerabilities in Polycom's ViewStation videoconferencing system.  A remote user can monitor videoconferences, retrieve files, or cause the device to crash.\nIt is reported that the ViewStation device is configured by default with a null or empty password for the administrator account. Also, the installation process does not prompt the administrator to provide a new password.  As a result, if a new password has not been set, a remote user could access the account to configure and manage the device.\n\nA remote user can reportedly supply a specially crafted HTTP request to the integrated web server using Unicode encoding to view information without having to authenticate to the system.  A remote user can exploit this flaw to download the administrator password and then gain full control over the system\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can cause the ViewStation camera to become unstable or crash by making multiple connection attempts to the embedded telnet server.  A remote user can also cause the camera to crash by sending one long ICMP packet or several malformed ICMP packets.\n\nThe following version are reported to be affected:\n\nPolycom ViewStation 128 version 7.2 and earlier\nPolycom ViewStation H.323 version 7.2 and earlier\nPolycom ViewStation 512 version 7.2 and earlier\nPolycom ViewStation MP version 7.2 and earlier\nPolycom ViewStation DCP version 7.2 and earlier\nPolycom ViewStation V.35 version 7.2 and earlier\nPolycom ViewStation FX/VS 4000 version 4.1.5 and earlier",
