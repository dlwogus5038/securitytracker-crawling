    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in Mozilla Firefox. A remote user can cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target user's system. A remote user can bypass security controls on the target system. A remote user can obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks. Mozilla Thunderbird is affected.\nA remote user can create specially crafted content that, when loaded by the target user, will trigger a memory corruption error and execute arbitrary code on the target user's system [CVE-2015-4513, CVE-2015-4514].\n\nA remote user can submit an NTLM request (via HTTP) to determine the hostname and potentially the Windows domain of the target system [CVE-2015-4515]\n\nThe Reader View does not properly disable script code in SVG animations in certain cases [CVE-2015-4518]. A remote user can bypass Reader mode security protections to potentially cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from an arbitrary site and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nOn Firefox for Android, the system may not restore the address bar when exiting fullscreen mode. A remote user may be able to exploit this to spoof the addressbar [CVE-2015-7185].\n\nOn Firefox for Android, an application may be able to invoke \"file://\" URIs to download additional files or open cached profile data [CVE-2015-7186].\n\nWhen a panel is created using the Add-on SDK in a browser extension with the \"script: false\" setting, the system may not disable the execution of inline script [CVE-2015-7187].\n\nA user can append white-space characters to hostnames that are IP addresses to bypass same-origin policy and potentially conduct cross-site scripting attacks [CVE-2015-7188].\n\nA remote user can trigger a buffer overflow in the JPEGEncoder function during script interactions with a canvas element and potentially execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7189].\n\nOn Firefox for Android, a remote user may be able to exploit a flaw in the Search feature to load a URL with system privileges and read arbitrary files on the target system [CVE-2015-7190].\n\nOn Firefox for Android, a remote user can exploit Android intents and fallback navigation to conduct cross-site scripting attacks [CVE-2015-7191].\n\nOn OS X systems, a remote user may be able to trigger an error when an accessibility tool requests the index of a table row through the NSAccessibilityIndexAttribute value and execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7192].\n\nA remote user can trigger an error in the processing of cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) \"preflight\" requests to bypass same-origin policy [CVE-2015-7193].\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted ZIP file that, when processed by the target user, will trigger a buffer underflow in libjar (libxul) and potentially execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7194].\n\nA remote user may be able to create a URL with certain escaped characters in the hostname to trigger a parsing error and potentially access site-specific tokens [CVE-2015-7195].\n\nA remote user can cause the Java plugin to deallocate a JavaScript wrapper when it is still in use, leading to a JavaScript garbage collection crash and potentially to code execution [CVE-2015-7196]. Systems with Java installed an enabled as a browser plugin are affected.\n\nSome flaws exist in the ANGLE graphics library, in SVG rendering, and in cryptographic key manipulation that could potentially execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7198, CVE-2015-7199, CVE-2015-7200]. A method to trigger these flaws has not been identified.\n\nA web worker can bypass mixed content policy for WebSockets when workers are used to create WebSockets [CVE-2015-7197].\n\nA remote user can trigger a buffer overflow in the ASN.1 decoder in Network Security Services (NSS) to execute arbitrary code [CVE-2015-7181, CVE-2015-7182, CVE-2015-7183].\n\nChristian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong, Andrew McCreight, Georg Fritzsche, Tyson Smith, Carsten Book, Tim Brown, Mario Heiderich, Frederik Braun, \nJordi Chancel, Jason Hamilton and Peter Arremann with AMO editor Sylvain Giroux, Michal Bentkowski, Looben Yang, Muneaki Nishimura, Frederic Wang, Shinto K Anto, \nGustavo Grieco, Frans Rosen, Vytautas Staraitis, Ronald Crane, Ehsan Akhgari, David Keeler, and Ryan Sleevi reported these vulnerabilities.",

A remote user can obtain potentially sensitive information.\nA remote user can create specially crafted HTML that, when loaded by the target user, will trigger a memory corruption error and execute arbitrary code on the target system [CVE-2015-2724, CVE-2015-2725, CVE-2015-2726, CVE-2015-2734, CVE-2015-2735, CVE-2015-2736, CVE-2015-2737, CVE-2015-2738, CVE-2015-2739, CVE-2015-2740]. The code will run with the privileges of the target user.\n\nA remote user can trigger a use-after-free memory error in CSPService::ShouldLoad() when a Content Policy modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) to remove a DOM object [CVE-2015-2731]. \n\nA remote user can trigger a use-after-free memory error when using XMLHttpRequest in conjunction with shared or dedicated workers [CVE-2015-2722, CVE-2015-2733].\n\nWhen an error that may be overridden occurs, key pinning checks may be missed [CVE-2015-2741].\n\nA remote user that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack can cause the target system to downgrade the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to 512-bit export-grade cryptography [CVE-2015-4000]. The remote user may then be able to decrypt the connection.\n\nThis vulnerability resides in the TLS protocol and not in the specific TLS implementation, but the vulnerability is exposed because the target system supports export-grade ciphers. This attack is known as the \"Logjam\" attack.\n\nA remote user (server) can exploit a flaw in Network Security Services (NSS) by failing to send the ServerKeyExchange message as part of a ECDHE_ECDSA exchange to cause the target NSS client to use the EC key from the ECDSA certificate, a downgraded exchange [CVE-2015-2721]. \n\nBob Clary, Christian Holler, Bobby Holley, Andrew McCreight, Terrence Cole, Steve Fink, Mats Palmgren, Wes Kocher, Andreas Pehrson, Tooru Fujisawa, Andrew Sutherland, Gary Kwong, Herre, Looben Yan, Ronald Crane, David Keeler, Matthew Green, David Adrian et al, and Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in Mozilla Thunderbird. A remote user can cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target user's system. A remote user can detect keystrokes when scripting is disabled in certain cases.\nA remote user can create specially crafted content that, when loaded by the target user, will trigger a memory corruption error and execute arbitrary code on the target system [CVE-2011-3660]. The code will run with the privileges of the target user.\n\nSpecially crafted JavaScript can trigger a flaw in the YARR regular expression library that could be triggered by javascript in web content [CVE-2011-3661]. Thunderbird 3.1 is not affected.\n\nIf SVG elements are removed during a DOMAttrModified event handler, an out-of-bounds memory access error may occur [CVE-2011-3658]. Thunderbird 8 users are affected only if using a browser-like feature that allows scripts to run.\n\nA remote user can exploit SVG animation accessKey events to detect key strokes even when JavaScript was disabled [CVE-2011-3663]. Accessing remote content is disabled by default.\n\nWhen a plugin deletes its containing DOM frame during a call from that frame, a null pointer dereference can occur on OS X [CVE-2011-3664].\n\nA crash may occur when scaling an OGG <video> element to extreme sizes [CVE-2011-3665].\n\nThe fix for the vulnerability reported in MFSA 2011-40 (to treat .jar files as executables) was incomplete on Mac OS X [CVE-2011-3666].\n\nAlexandre Poirot, Chris Blizzard, Kyle Huey, Scoobidiver, Christian Holler, David Baron, Gary Kwong, Jim Blandy, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Marcia Knous, Rober Longson, Aki Helin, regenrecht (via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative), Mario Heiderich, Richard Bateman, and sczimmer reported these vulnerabilities.",

Secunia Research discovered this vulnerability.\n\nThe browser may not properly clear a JavaScript reference to a frame or window when the referenced content is deleted, allowing native code to be executed [MFSA 2006-44; CVE-2006-3801].  Thunderbird is affected if Javascript is enabled in mail.  Thilo Girmann discovered this vulnerability.\n\nA web page can hijack native DOM methods on a target document object in a different domain to cause arbitrary scripting code to run in the target domain [MFSA 2006-47; CVE-2006-3802].  Thunderbird is affected if Javascript is enabled. Thor Larholm discovered this vulnerability.\n\nA script can redefine the standard Object() constructor of a named Javascript function to return a reference to a privileged target object, allowing the script to execute with elevated privileges [MFSA 2006-51; CVE-2006-3807].

This may allow a remote user to execute arbitrary code on the target user's system.  Masatoshi Kimura reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can pass optional Certificate Authority name arguments to trigger an array index pointer overflow in crypto.signText() [MFSA 2006-38]. Mikolaj Habryn reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can invoke content-defined setters on an object prototype to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges [MFSA 2006-37]. Paul Nickerson reported this vulnerability and moz_bug_r_a4 developed a demonstration exploit proof-of-concept.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, persisted XUL attributes may be associated with the wrong URL. A remote user may be able to exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the target user's system [MFSA 2006-35]. Jonas Sicking reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can conduct HTTP response smuggling attacks against the target user when Thunderbird is used with certain proxy servers [MFSA 2006-33]. Kazuho Oku of Cybozu Labs reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user may be able to cause the target user's e-mail client to crash or execute arbitrary code [MFSA 2006-32]. The vendor discovered these vulnerabilities.\n\nA remote user can create javascript to be run via EvalInSandbox that can escape the sandbox and gain elevated privileges [MFSA 2006-31].

    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in Evolution.  A remote user can cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target user's system.\nSeveral format string vulnerabilities exists in Evolution that result from the method used to process data from remote sources.\n\nThe first vulnerability involves viewing vCard data attached to an e-mail message.  When a message of this type is opened, a condensed view of the vCard is displayed and the vulnerability exploit is not triggered.  In order to be triggered, a user must view the entire vCard or perform a similar action such as saving the vCard in the address book and viewing the saved data in Contacts.\n\nThe flaw can be exploited by sending emails with malicious code in the vcards attachments sent to Evolution users. \n\nThe second format string vulnerability involves the display of contact data from remote LDAP servers.  \n\nThe third format string vulnerability involves the display of task list data from\nremote servers.\n\nThe fourth format string vulnerability involves using the Calendar tab to save task list data that is vulnerable to the third vulnerability described above.  Other calendar entries that do not come from task lists are also affected.\n\nUlf Harnhammar of the Swedish IT Incident Centre (SITIC) reported the vulnerabilities.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target user's system.  The code is typically executed with the privileges of the user, service, application that was used to activate the code.",

    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in Evolution.  A remote user can cause arbitrary code to be executed on the target user's system.\nSeveral format string vulnerabilities exists in Evolution that result from the method used to process data from remote sources.\n\nThe first vulnerability involves viewing vCard data attached to an e-mail message.  When a message of this type is opened, a condensed view of the vCard is displayed and the vulnerability exploit is not triggered.  In order to be triggered, a user must view the entire vCard or perform a similar action such as saving the vCard in the address book and viewing the saved data in Contacts.\n\nThe flaw can be exploited by sending emails with malicious code in the vcards attachments sent to Evolution users. \n\nThe second format string vulnerability involves the display of contact data from remote LDAP servers.  \n\nThe third format string vulnerability involves the display of task list data from\nremote servers.\n\nThe fourth format string vulnerability involves using the Calendar tab to save task list data that is vulnerable to the third vulnerability described above.  Other calendar entries that do not come from task lists are also affected.\n\nUlf Harnhammar of the Swedish IT Incident Centre (SITIC) reported the vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was originally reported in the Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) web browser that allows a remote user to silently install and execute arbitrary code on Windows 98 computers.  Microsoft has issued an advisory indicating that the flaw is in Outlook Express in the processing of MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML (MHTML) URLs.  A remote user could cause arbitrary code to be executed on a target user's computer when a specially crafted URL is loaded by the target user.\nIt is reported that a remote user can cause IE to inject arbitrary HTML into the \"My Computer\" zone on Windows 98 systems by exploiting the \"Web Folder\" component of IE.  Code can be made to traverse the web folder.  If the web folder does not exists, IE will reportedly place an error message in the temporary folder.  So, code can be written to probe for or test vulnerable systems.\n\nA remote user can create HTML to cause an HTML 404 error message to be issued by IE.  Some demonstration code is provided:\n\n<body onload=malware() style=\"behavior: url(#default#httpFolder);\">\n <script>\nfunction malware(){\ndocument.body.navigate(\"http://www.microsoft.com\");alert\n(\"malware\");open(\"file://C%3A%5CWINDOWS%5CTemp%5Cwecerr.txt\")\n}\n </script>>\n\nThis will cause a text-based error message to be placed in the temporary folder.  According to the report, custom error messages can be created as follows:\n\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html;\n charset=\"Windows-1252\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n\n<br><br>\n<body bgcolor=black>\n<center><font size=\"24\" color=\"red\" \nface=\"arial\">malware</font></center>\n\nThen, the remote user can create HTML that includes an 'mhtml' URL to point to the error file location in the temporary directory, causing IE to execute the local file:\n\nopen(\"mhtml:file://C%3A%5CWINDOWS%5CTemp%5Cwecerr.txt\")\n\nThe HTML in the file, including arbitrary Activex objects, will be executed in the Local Computer zone.\n\nA demonstration exploit is available at:\n\nhttp://www.malware.com/behave.html",

A remote user could cause denial of service situations, could bypass security checks, and may be able to cause arbitrary commands to be executed on the target system.\nCore Security Technologies reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted UUencode header within an e-mail to cause the Evolution client to crash when the e-mail is parsed.  This can create a temporary denial of service condition until the recipient removes the malicious e-mail from their mailbox. \n\nA remote user can also send e-mail that is UUencoded several times to cause the recipient's e-mail client to allocate memory and potentially crash.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted MIME Content-ID header as part of a MIME image part to cause arbitrary data to be passed to GTKHtml for processing.  This could cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.  This could also be used to bypass the \"Don't connect to remote hosts to fetch images\" option, according to the report.  Additionally, this could be used to pass arbitrary content to some bonobo components on the recipient's system.\n\nSome demonstration exploit examples are provided in the Source Message.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in the Ximian Evolution e-mail client software.  A remote user could cause denial of service situations, could bypass security checks, and may be able to cause arbitrary commands to be executed on the target system.\nCore Security Technologies reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted UUencode header within an e-mail to cause the Evolution client to crash when the e-mail is parsed.  This can create a temporary denial of service condition until the recipient removes the malicious e-mail from their mailbox. \n\nA remote user can also send e-mail that is UUencoded several times to cause the recipient's e-mail client to allocate memory and potentially crash.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted MIME Content-ID header as part of a MIME image part to cause arbitrary data to be passed to GTKHtml for processing.  This could cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.  This could also be used to bypass the \"Don't connect to remote hosts to fetch images\" option, according to the report.  Additionally, this could be used to pass arbitrary content to some bonobo components on the recipient's system.\n\nSome demonstration exploit examples are provided in the Source Message.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in the Ximian Evolution e-mail client software.  A remote user could cause denial of service situations, could bypass security checks, and may be able to cause arbitrary commands to be executed on the target system.\nCore Security Technologies reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted UUencode header within an e-mail to cause the Evolution client to crash when the e-mail is parsed.  This can create a temporary denial of service condition until the recipient removes the malicious e-mail from their mailbox. \n\nA remote user can also send e-mail that is UUencoded several times to cause the recipient's e-mail client to allocate memory and potentially crash.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted MIME Content-ID header as part of a MIME image part to cause arbitrary data to be passed to GTKHtml for processing.  This could cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.  This could also be used to bypass the \"Don't connect to remote hosts to fetch images\" option, according to the report.

A remote user can send a message that can cause the recipient's client to crash or execute arbitrary code.\nIt is reported that a remote user can create a specially crafted and digitally signed Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) e-mail message to trigger the buffer overflow.  According to the vendor, the vulnerability resides in code that generates a warning message when a particular error condition associated with digital signatures occurs. \n\nIn accordance with RFC 2311, an error message is displayed when the \"From\" field of the e-mail does not match the S/MIME RFC822 Name.  The error message apparently displays the signer's name and the sender's name (i.e., the \"From\" field).  The buffer overflow reportedly occurs in the code that injects the the sender's email address into the message.\n\nThe code will be executed when the recipient opens the mail or views it through Preview Mode.\n\nMicrosoft Outlook is reportedly not affected.\n\nMicrosoft credits Noam Rathaus of Beyond Security Ltd. with reporting this flaw.",

A remote user may be able to cause arbitrary code to be executed when fetchmail is operating in multi-drop mode.\nIt is reported that there are several buffer overflow conditions that can be triggered when fetchmail is running in multi-drop mode.\n\nIn several places, the readheaders() parsing function reportedly copies user-supplied email addresses to fixed size buffers without checking the size of the email address.\n\nA broken boundary check is reported in the getmxrecord() function.  A remote user that can send a specially crafted DNS packet to the target server can exploit this flaw to cause fetchmail to crash.\n\nA bug is also reported in the parse_received() function affecting the parsing of user-supplied \"Received:\" headers.  Portions of the \"Received:\" header line are copied without validating the size of the copied portion.  A remote user can send mail with a specially crafted \"Received:\" header line to cause fetchmail to overflow the heap with arbitrary code.  This bug allows a remote user to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\nThe vendor credits Stefan Esser (e-matters) for reporting these flaws.

The exploit involves placing executable content in the Temporary Internet File folder.\n\nAccording to the report, XML files (on Windows machines, of course) are associated with the Internet Explorer (IE) application and require a style sheet to be linked to the XML file.   It is reported that the XSL style sheet can contain HTML and scripting code and can be embedded within the XML file itself to avoid security restrictions, as shown:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<?xml-stylesheet type=\"text/css\" \nhref=\"http://www.malware.com/malware.css\" ?>\n<malware>\n\n<h4 style=\"position: absolute;top:39;left:expression(alert\n(document.location));font-family:arial;font-size:12pt;BACKGROUND-\nIMAGE:url('http://www.malware.com/youlickit.gif');background-\nrepeat:no-repeat;background-position: 100 30;z-index:-\n100;height:200pt;width:400pt;font-family:Verdana;color:red\">sure it \ncan, malware says so</h4>\n</malware>\n\nThis code will generate an error in the XML parser but will execute the HTML and scripting.  Because the file is opened from within the TIF folder by IE, the scripting code can determine the exact file location.

A remote user can send a specially crafted e-mail message to the target (victim) user to cause the target user's e-mail client to crash when checking for new mail or when viewing a message.\nIt is reported that a remote user can place more than 259 characters in either the SMTP \"From:\" or \"To:\" mail headers to cause the recipient's Pegasus Mail client to crash.\n\nA demonstration expoit mail header is shown below:\n\nFrom: myname <250'A's>\nTo: test@localhost\nSubject: Good crash\n\nAccording to the report, the client will crash when checking for new mail or when viewing the affected message.  The recipient may have to manually delete the message before the client will properly reopen.  The mail client may also crash when the recipient attempts to delete the message from the trash.\n\nThe author of the report has provided a demonstration exploit and an unofficial patch in the Source Message (in a Base64-encoded zip file).\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in Outlook Express (OE).  A remote user can send malicious e-mail with an attachment that will bypass OE's malicious file type filter and misrepresent the name and size of the file.\nA remote user can reportedly send an e-mail with a malicious attachment that can bypass the malicious file filter using specially crafted MIME headers.  A demonstration exploit header (for use within the attachment boundary) is provided:\n\nContent-Type: application/asx\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=\"newtitle.chm\"\n\nA remote user can reportedly modify the way the file name extension and file size will be displayed on the recipient's Outlook Express client.  For example, the following type of attachment file name can be used to cause the client to display the wrong file attachment size:\n\n\"newtitle.chm (45.6 KB)           [...]\"\n\nIn another example, the file extension can be masked:\n\n\"newtitle.asx (45.6 KB)   [...].chm\"\n\nThe true extension will be known by the recipient when the recipient attempts to open or save the attachment and receives the attachment warning.  However, according to the report, the attachment warning can also be bypassed if a file name containing spaces is used.  An example file name is provided:\n\n\"newtitle.asx .chm\"\n\nIt is reported that the space and all characters following the space are cropped in the attachment warning.  It is reported that sometimes the client will crop the entire attachment file name, particularly when it is a long name.\n\nA remote user can also cause the attachment to be represented by the default icon instead of a type-specific icon.  To do this, the remote use must append two or more 0x2E characters (\".\") to the end of the filename.\n\nA sample '.eml' exploit file for these vulnerabilities is available at:\n\nhttp://www.murphy.101main.net/Oe6_issues.eml\n\nThe author of the report indicates that Outlook may also be vulnerable, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

This configuration is apparently referred to as \"WordMail\".\n\nA remote user can send malicious mail to a target (victim) user so that when the target user replies to the mail or forwards the mail, arbitrary code is executed.  This is apparently possible because of a flaw in the security restrictions that the WordMail editor applies when Outlook is editing a message (as opposed to reading it).  Scripts are reportedly not blocked in this mode.

    "Description": "A potential vulnerability was reported in Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client.  The software incorrectly interprets mail headers and may present header-embedded attachments that contain malicious code and have bypassed content scanning engines.\nIn the original report, it was reported that Outlook incorrectly interprets Carriage Returns (0x0d or <CR>) contained in SMTP mail headers as Carriage Return/Line Feed combinations (0x0d 0x0a or <CRLF>). As a result, an Outlook user may receive a message in which headers are incorrectly interpreted as message data. A user may be presented with attachments that do not exist (in accordance with RFC 822). It is reported that both UUencoded and MIME encoded attachments are affected by this bug. \n\nThe author of the original report has clarified and corrected some details:\n\nTo hide a UUencoded attachment within the header so that Outlook will see the attachment reportedly requires a regular <CRLF> at the end of the UUencoded attachment.  So, the hidden attachment would look as follows:\n\nX-some-header: <CR><CR>begin  hiding.txt<CR>.....uuencoding....<CR>....<CRLF>`<CR>end<CR>",

    "Description": "SECURITY.NNOV warned of security issues with Microsoft Outlook Express's Secure Password Authentication feature.\nOutlook Express apparently offers a Secure Password Authentication (SPA) option for authenticating a remote client to a POP3/IMAP/SMTP server without sending a cleartext password over the network.\n\nIt is reported that SPA is based on NTLM v.1, which is known to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.  If a remote user can impersonate a mail server, the remote user can authenticate to the mail server with the remote client's credentials or to other servers that support NTLMv1 authentication.  The remote client may be tricked into thinking it is authenticated by a valid mail server.\n\nIt is reported that when SPA is used for POP3 access (for example) account in Outlook Express, the remote Outlook Express client does not use the POP3 username/password provided in the POP3 transaction.  Instead, it attempts to connect to the POP3 server with the user's Windows  NT domain logon credentials.  If this fails, Outlook Express reportedly requests the user's username/password information and stores this in the users's password list.  This single username/password will apparently be used for all Outlook Express accounts on the same server.  It is reported that a malicious server (or man-in-the-middle) can cause some \"AUTH NTLM\" challenge/response exchanges to occur during a remote client's authentication attempt without prompting the remote user.  This gives the man-in-the-middle the opportunity to connect to several password-protected resources using the remote user's credentials.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in Yahoo Mail that reportedly makes it possible for a remote user to send e-mail to a recipient containing Javascript code in a link that will be executed if the link is clicked.  The Javascript code could then automatically send mail to all of the destinations listed in the recipient's inbox without user intervention.\nTo trigger the cross-site scripting vulnerability, a remote user can send an e-mail message to the target recipient, where the e-mail contains a link to Yahoo's own server.  If the link contains escaped Javascript, it will be executed when the recipient clicks on the link (this is a requirement).  That javascript could then open a window on the recipient's browser that could nagivate through the recipient's inbox, sending messages to all e-mail addresses listed in the recipient's inbox.  Because the malicious javascript code is executing inside a page from the mail service's own server, there will reportedly be no domain-bounding error when the javascript is controlling the window with the victim's inbox.\n\nSome sample links and the worm code are available at: \nhttp://www.sidesport.com/webworm/\n\nThe vendor was reportedly notified.",

The attachment is replaced by certain plain text on a single line with no leading whitespace in the message body where the MIME-part was located (e.g., Attachment Converted: \"<filepath>\").\n\nDue to this implementation, a remote user could send a message to the victim that contained an \"attachment converted\" line in the text of the message pointing to a known file on the victim's host.  If the message is then forwarded by the victim, the specified file will be attached to the outgoing forwarded message.\n\nIt is reported that Eudora does not show the message as containing attachments.",

    "Description": "It has been advised that \"The Bat!\" (an e-mail client) contains a vulnerability that may allow any user of the e-mail client to save files in an unauthorized directory on the disk where file storage is provided.\nSECURITY.NNOV released an advisory indicating that The Bat! performs unauthorized directory traversal.\n\nUnder normal operation, users can store attached files independently of the original e-mail message in a user-specific directory.  This feature is disabled by default, but is reportedly used often.  The Bat! does not ordinarily permit the filename to contain the '\\' symbol.  However, if the filename is specified as an RFC 2047 encoded word, the character checking is not performed.  This allows the user to specify any directory on the disk.\n\nThe vendor  (Rit  Labs)  was  reportedly contacted on December 21, 2000.",
    "Impact'": "A malicious user of the e-mail client can save files in any directory of the disk where file storage is performed.  The user could save malicious batch files or executables.  Apparently, it is usually only possible to write new files and not overwrite existing files.  However, files can be overwritten  if the \"extract files  to\" feature is configured in the message filtering rules and the \"overwrite file\" function is selected.",
