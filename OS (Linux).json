    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel. A remote user can obtain potentially sensitive information about a target TCP connection in certain cases. A remote user can cause denial of service conditions against the target TCP connection or hijack the target TCP connection in certain cases.\nA remote user can conduct a side-channel attack against TCP connections to determine if two arbitrary hosts have established a TCP connection and to potentially hijack the connection in certain cases.\n\nA remote user that can establish a separate TCP connection to the target system can send specially crafted TCP RST and TCP SYN packets to cause the target system to respond with a number of challenge ACK packets that exceed the target system's challenge ACK maximum while at the same time sending spoofed packets with a source address of a second target system to the first target system. If the total maximum number of challenge ACK packets are returned to the remote user from the first target system, then the remote user can infer that a connection does not exist between the two target systems.

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in FreeBSD when running on AMD processors.  A local user may be able to obtain sensitive information.  The Linux kernel is also affected.\nOn \"7th generation\" and \"8th generation\" processors manufactured by AMD, the fxsave and fxrstor instructions do not save and restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP registers unless the exception summary bit (ES) in the x87 status word is set (whereas other processors store this information regardless of the ES bit).\n\nAs a result, the FreeBSD kernel does not restore the contents of the FOP, FIP, and FDP registers between context switches.  This may allow a local user to monitor the execution path of a process that uses floating-point operations to obtain potentially sensitive information.\n\nSystems that do not use AMD Athlon, Duron, Athlon MP, Athlon XP, Athlon64, Athlon64 FX, Opteron, Turion, or Sempron processors are not affected.\n\nThe vendor credits Jan Beulich with reporting this vulnerability.",
    "Impact'": "A local user can monitor the execution path of a process that uses floating-point operations, which may allow the user to obtain cryptographic keys or other potentially sensitive information.",
    "Solution": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux is affected by this vulnerability.

The Linux kernel is also affected.\nOn \"7th generation\" and \"8th generation\" processors manufactured by AMD, the fxsave and fxrstor instructions do not save and restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP registers unless the exception summary bit (ES) in the x87 status word is set (whereas other processors store this information regardless of the ES bit).\n\nAs a result, the FreeBSD kernel does not restore the contents of the FOP, FIP, and FDP registers between context switches.  This may allow a local user to monitor the execution path of a process that uses floating-point operations to obtain potentially sensitive information.\n\nSystems that do not use AMD Athlon, Duron, Athlon MP, Athlon XP, Athlon64, Athlon64 FX, Opteron, Turion, or Sempron processors are not affected.\n\nThe vendor credits Jan Beulich with reporting this vulnerability.",

    "Description": "In January 2005, a vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel in 'ptrace32.c'.  A local user can cause denial of service conditions.\nA local user can execute 'ltrace -i' using the 32-bit version of ltrace on a 64-bit executable to cause the kernel to crash.\n\nThis find_target() function does not properly handle a NULL value returned from find_task_by_pid() in this case.  As a result, the put_task_struct() is called and a kernel oops may occur.\n\nMark Bellon reported this vulnerability.",
    "Impact'": "A local user can cause the kernel to crash.",
    "Solution": "Red Hat has released a fix.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux AS version

A remote or local user can view potentially sensitive kernel memory contents.\nThe ext2_make_empty() function does not properly clear filesystem contents when creating a directory.  The block written to store the '.' and '..' directory entries is not properly initialized.  As a result, approximately 4k of kernel memory may be leaked into the file system for each directory created.\n\nA local or remote user with access to the filesystem (or filesystem images or devices) can obtain potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe vendor was notified on March 16, 2005.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://arkoon.net/advisories/ext2-make-empty-leak.txt\n\nMathieu Lafon and Romain Francoise from Arkoon Security Team reported this vulnerability.",

A local user can obtain root privileges.\nPaul Starzetz of iSEC Security Research reported that the Linux binary format loader load_elf_library() function in 'binfmt_elf.c' does not properly process memory segments.  A do_brk() call is made without holding the relevant mmap semaphore.  As a result, a local user can exploit a race condition to inject a virtual memory address descriptor into the wrong location and cause arbitrary code to be executed with root privileges.\n\nThe binfmt_aout binary format loader contains a similar flaw.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://www.isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0021-uselib.txt",

A local user may be able to read kernel memory.\nRed Hat reported that the Linux kernel contains a signed integer boundary error in the cpufreq ioctl proc handler.  A user-supplied signed integer is cast to a signed integer and then used in copying memory.  As a result, a local user can read or write arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.\n\nA local user can read arbitrary portions of kernel memory.  A root-level user can also write to arbitrary memory locations.\n\nThe flaw resides in 'drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c'.\n\nBrad Spengler is credited with discovering this flaw.",

A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system with kernel-level privileges.  [Editor's note:  This report has been disputed.]\nShaun Colley reported that a local user can trigger an integer overflow in the sctp_setsockopt() option when the 'SCTP_SOCKOPT_DEBUG_NAME' socket option is set.  The flaw reportedly resides in 'net/sctp/socket.c', where an unsigned integer (optlen) that governs memory allocation may be incremented even when the integer is at its maximum value.  As a result, a remote user can supply a value such that the integer will overflow and the function will not allocate enough memory to hold the user-supplied 'optval' contents.  A subsequent copy_from_user() function call will then copy large amounts of user-supplied data to kernel memory, overwriting portions of kernel memory.\n\nStefan Esser reported that sys_setsockopt() first checks to ensure that optlen is not less than zero, so an integer overflow cannot occur.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux 2.6 kernel in ncpfs.  A local user can gain elevated privileges on the target system.\nIt is reported that ncp_lookup() does not validate name component lengths.  A local user can cause data to overflow onto the stack, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nArjan van de Ven is credited with discovering this flaw.\n\n[Editor's note:  It is not clear if the 2.4 kernel or any other kernel series is affected.]",

A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system with kernel-level privileges.  [Editor's note:  This report has been disputed.]\nShaun Colley reported that a local user can trigger an integer overflow in the sctp_setsockopt() option when the 'SCTP_SOCKOPT_DEBUG_NAME' socket option is set.  The flaw reportedly resides in 'net/sctp/socket.c', where an unsigned integer (optlen) that governs memory allocation may be incremented even when the integer is at its maximum value.  As a result, a remote user can supply a value such that the integer will overflow and the function will not allocate enough memory to hold the user-supplied 'optval' contents.  A subsequent copy_from_user() function call will then copy large amounts of user-supplied data to kernel memory, overwriting portions of kernel memory.\n\nStefan Esser reported that sys_setsockopt() first checks to ensure that optlen is not less than zero, so an integer overflow cannot occur.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel in the cpufreq_userspace proc handler.  A local user may be able to read kernel memory.\nRed Hat reported that the Linux kernel contains a signed integer boundary error in the cpufreq ioctl proc handler.  A user-supplied signed integer is cast to a signed integer and then used in copying memory.  As a result, a local user can read or write arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.\n\nA local user can read arbitrary portions of kernel memory.  A root-level user can also write to arbitrary memory locations.\n\nThe flaw resides in 'drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c'.\n\nBrad Spengler is credited with discovering this flaw.",

    "Description": "An integer overflow was reported in the Linux kernel in the setsockopt(2) system call.  A local user can gain root privileges on the target system.\nWojciech Purczynski of iSEC reported that a local user can call the ip_setsockopt()  function with the MCAST_MSFILTER option to trigger an integer overflow and execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service conditions.\n\nThe flaw resides in the 'net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c' file, where the IP_MSFILTER_SIZE is not properly defined, the report said.\n\nThe vulnerable code was reportedly introduced into the kernel in the 2.4.22 and 2.6.1 kernel releases.\n\nPaul Starzetz is credited with discovering the flaw.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0015-msfilter.txt",
    "Impact'": "A local user can execute arbitrary code on the target system with root privileges.\n\nA local user can cause denial of service conditions (e.g., crash, reboot) on the target system.",

A local user can cause denial of service conditions and may be able to execute arbitrary code.\nShaun Colley reported an integer overflow in the 'dir' command, similar to a flaw in the 'ls' command reported by Georgi Guninski in October 2003 [and published in our Alert ID 1007981].\n\nThe flaw can be triggered when a specially crafted integer value is passed using the '-w' command line flag, resulting in stack corruption and 100% CPU utilization, the report said.\n\nA demonstration exploit command is provided:\n\ndir -w 1073741828",

    "Description": "Another vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel do_mremap() function.  A local user can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\nPaul Starzetz discovered and reported that there is a missing return value check within the mremap(2) system call.\n\nWhen resizing or moving virtual memory areas, the function reportedly does not test the return value of the do_munmap() function.  Cases where the function fails (for example, due to the number of virtual memory areas being exceeded by the calling process) will not be properly detected, according to the report.  As a result, the kernel may move memory belonging to one process into memory space that is allocated to another process.\n\nSome other calls to the do_munmap() function are also not checked, the report said.\n\nA local user can gain root privileges on the target system.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0014-mremap-unmap.txt",

    "Description": "Another vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel do_mremap() function.  A local user can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\nPaul Starzetz discovered and reported that there is a missing return value check within the mremap(2) system call.\n\nWhen resizing or moving virtual memory areas, the function reportedly does not test the return value of the do_munmap() function.  Cases where the function fails (for example, due to the number of virtual memory areas being exceeded by the calling process) will not be properly detected, according to the report.  As a result, the kernel may move memory belonging to one process into memory space that is allocated to another process.\n\nSome other calls to the do_munmap() function are also not checked, the report said.\n\nA local user can gain root privileges on the target system.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0014-mremap-unmap.txt",

A local user can gain elevated privileges.\nPaul Starzetz and Wojciech Purczynski of iSEC Security Research reported that the mremap(2) system call does not perform proper bounds checking in the do_mremap() kernel code.  A local user can reportedly cause the kernel to remap memory and create a virtual memory area that is 0 bytes in length.\n\nAccording to the report, a local user can gain root privileges on the system through non-trivial exploit methods.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0013-mremap.txt",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux operating system kernel.  A local user may be able to trick a privileged process into thinking that it is operating with a different directory.\nIt is reported that the kernel d_path() function may return a truncated path name instead of an error value for long path names. This function is apparently called by the getcwd(2) system call and the do_proc_readlink() function.  User-space processes that implement these calls may receive incorrect information regarding directory paths.\n\nIt is reported that that the d_path kernel function resolves a string that is a concatenation of subsequent path components starting from the trailing path component into a 'dentry'. The concatenated path name is apparently stored in a fixed-length buffer of PAGE_SIZE bytes.  If a dentry points to a path that exceeds PAGE_SIZE - 1 characters length, leading path components are not written to the buffer and function instead returns truncated path without an error value, according to the report.\n\nA local user may be able to cause a privileged process to interpret that the proper directory name is an arbitrary directory.\n\nA demonstration exploit is provided in the Source Message.",
    "Impact'": "A local user may be able to cause a privileged process to interpret that the proper directory name is an arbitrary directory.  The process may read or write to the wrong directory.",

A local user can gain root level privileges.\nIt is reported that the do_brk() function does not perform proper bounds checking.  A local user can run a userland application to cause the kernel to grant the local user access to the full kernel address space.

    "Date": "Aug  2 2003",
    "Impact": "Denial of service via network",
    "Fix Available": "Yes",
    "Vendor Confirmed": "Yes",
    "Version(s)": "2.4.20",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in Netfilter in the connection tracking function.  On certain versions of the Linux kernel, a remote user can cause denial of service conditions on the target system.\nAccording to the report, only systems running the Linux 2.4.20 kernel are affected.  Previous and more recent versions are not affected.\n\nIf the CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK configuration option is enabled or if the ip_conntrack module is loaded on that particular kernel version, the system may be vulnerable.\n\nThe 2.4.20 kernel reportedly introduced a new method for providing linked list support, but the netfilter code was relying on the old method to identify 'UNCONFIRMED' connections (i.e., those that have only been detected in one direction).  These 'UNCONFIRMED' connects are reportedly assigned a \"very high\" timeout.  As a result, a remote user can generate traffic that will be labeled as 'UNCONFIRMED' by the netfilter code to consume memory on the target system.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can cause denial of service conditions on the target system.",
    "Solution": "The vendor has released a fixed version, available in Linux kernel 2.4.21.  Patches for kernel version 2.4.20 are also provided in the Source Message and at the Vendor URL.\n\nAs a workaround, the vendor indicates that you should not use connection tracking on kernel versions 2.4.20.",

    "Description": "In the original report (based on a Red Hat Errata), it was noted that there was a configuration vulnerability in the kernel-utils package in uml_net.  An updated report indicates that the upstream version of uml_net is still vulnerable and that a local user can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\nA local user can reportedly supply a large negative version number to cause uml_net to execute arbitrary code.  Because uml_net is configured with set user id (setuid) root user privileges, the code will run with root privileges.\n\n[Editor's note:  The original Red Hat advisory RHSA-2003:056-08 did not mention the negative integer overflow vulnerability, instead indicating that the main problem with uml_net was that the utility was improperly configured with setuid root user privileges, and the solution appears to have been associated with removing the setuid status.  The related Red Hat bugzilla bug report #83685 submitted by Johnny Robertson accuractly mentioned the integer overflow flaw.  However, at the time of this entry, the vulnerability had not been corrected in the upstream uml_net distribution.  Credit goes to ktha@hushmail.com for noting the flaw in the upstream version and confirming that arbitrary code can indeed be executed.]",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux operating system kernel (version 2.2.x) in the /proc/pid/mem interface.  A local user could cause the system to crash, requiring a manual reboot to return to normal operations.\nRAZOR issued an advisory warning of a flaw in how the /proc/pid/mem mmap() function is validated.  According to the report, the /proc/pid/mem interface is used to allow an application to access the memory of another application and is useful in debugging processes, but contains a flaw.\n\nA local user could invoke mmap() with the PROT_READ parameter to request read access to memory pages that are non-readable to the traced process.  Due to the flaw, the local user may be granted a memory map that is marked as readable.  Then, the local user can reportedly request the kernel to read this memory, causing the system to crash.\n\nSome demonstration exploit code is provided in the Source Message.\n\nAccording to the report, the 2.4.x kernel does not contain the functionality needed to exploit this flaw, and so is \"not immediately vulnerable.\"",
    "Impact'": "A local user could cause the system to hang.  A manual reboot may be required to return the system to normal operations.",
    "Solution": "It is reported that, due to implementation reliability issues, the vendor will drop /proc/pid/mem mmap() functionality in 2.2 kernels. Because of this, there will be no fix for the issue that preserves the functionality.\n\nThe upcoming 2.2.24 release will reportedly address this issue.\n\nA patch to disable the functionality is provided in the Source Message and in the RAZOR advisory at:\n\nhttp://razor.bindview.com/publish/advisories/adv_mmap.html\n\nPlease read the instructions and caveats if you consider using the patch.",

A local user may be able to read arbitrary network traffic in certain circumstances.\nAccording to the report, a userspace process without NET_ADMIN privileges can re-use the process id (PID) of a previous privileged process and possibly receive a limited amount of network traffic.\n\nThis would reportedly only occur if no network traffic had been queued after the privileged process exited and the unprivileged process was established.  Also, the kernel module will only transmit a limited number of packets to the userspace process without acknowledgment, limited to the queue length (the default is 1024 packets).\n\nIf a system has Netfilter (or iptables) enabled and the ip_queue or ip6_queue experimental IP queuing modules are being used, the system may be vulnerable.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel 'netfilter' firewall software that may allow remote users to access protected hosts in certain situations, depending on the firewall rule set.\nIt is reported that the netfilter connection tracking helper module for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) protocol contains a flaw.  This module is designed to monitor outgoing DCC CHAT/SEND requests and issue 'conntrack expectations' about the pending inbound DCC connections.  According to the report, the conntrack expectation is less precise than it should be, causing unwanted ports for inbound connections to be opened on the firewall.\n\nThe conntrack expectation is reportedly described by a 5-tuple (layer 4 protocol, source ip, source port, destination ip, destination port) and a mask that indicates the parts of the tuple that must match for a new connection to be accepted.  An implementation bug apparently causes the mask to be too wide in specifying the destination IP address (allowing any destination IP instead of a specific one).  As a result, incoming connection requests are only matched on the destination port number and not the destination IP address. \n\nThe vendor credits Jozsef Kadlecsik with discovering this bug.",
    "Impact'": "The impact reportedly depends on the ruleset in effect on the firewall.  In some cases (with, for example, a permissive \"-m state --state RELATED -j ACCEPT\" rule), a remote user may be able to traverse the firewall on a single port number to any destination IP address behind the firewall as soon as a user on the inside of the firewall issues an outbound IRC DCC request specifying that port number.",
    "Solution": "Mandrake has issued a fix.  MandrakeSoft encourages all users to upgrade their kernel as soon as possible to these new 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.\n\nMandrake notes that this update cannot be accomplished via MandrakeUpdate; it must be done on the console.  This prevents one from upgrading a kernel instead of installing a new kernel.  To upgrade, please ensure that you have first upgraded iptables, mkinitrd, and initscripts packages if they are applicable to your platform.  Use \"rpm -ivh kernel_package\" to install the new kernel.  Prior to rebooting, double-check your /etc/lilo.conf, /boot/grub/menu.lst, or /etc/yaboot.conf (PPC users only) to ensure that you are able to boot properly into both old and new kernels (this will allow you to boot into the old kernel if the new kernel does not work to your liking).\n\nLILO users should execute \"/sbin/lilo -v\", GRUB users should execute \"sh /boot/grun/install.sh\", and PPC users must type \"/sbin/ybin -v\" to write the boot record in order to reboot into the new kernel if you made any changes to the respective boot configuration files.\n\nNew kernels for Mandrake Linux

A local user may be able to trick a privileged process into thinking that it is operating with a different directory.\nIt is reported that the kernel d_path() function may return a truncated path name instead of an error value for long path names. This function is apparently called by the getcwd(2) system call and the do_proc_readlink() function.  User-space processes that implement these calls may receive incorrect information regarding directory paths.\n\nIt is reported that that the d_path kernel function resolves a string that is a concatenation of subsequent path components starting from the trailing path component into a 'dentry'. The concatenated path name is apparently stored in a fixed-length buffer of PAGE_SIZE bytes.  If a dentry points to a path that exceeds PAGE_SIZE - 1 characters length, leading path components are not written to the buffer and function instead returns truncated path without an error value, according to the report.\n\nA local user may be able to cause a privileged process to interpret that the proper directory name is an arbitrary directory.\n\nA demonstration exploit is provided in the Source Message.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel 'netfilter' firewall software that may allow remote users to access protected hosts in certain situations, depending on the firewall rule set.\nIt is reported that the netfilter connection tracking helper module for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) protocol contains a flaw.  This module is designed to monitor outgoing DCC CHAT/SEND requests and issue 'conntrack expectations' about the pending inbound DCC connections.  According to the report, the conntrack expectation is less precise than it should be, causing unwanted ports for inbound connections to be opened on the firewall.\n\nThe conntrack expectation is reportedly described by a 5-tuple (layer 4 protocol, source ip, source port, destination ip, destination port) and a mask that indicates the parts of the tuple that must match for a new connection to be accepted.  An implementation bug apparently causes the mask to be too wide in specifying the destination IP address (allowing any destination IP instead of a specific one).  As a result, incoming connection requests are only matched on the destination port number and not the destination IP address. \n\nThe vendor credits Jozsef Kadlecsik with discovering this bug.",
    "Impact'": "The impact reportedly depends on the ruleset in effect on the firewall.  In some cases (with, for example, a permissive \"-m state --state RELATED -j ACCEPT\" rule), a remote user may be able to traverse the firewall on a single port number to any destination IP address behind the firewall as soon as a user on the inside of the firewall issues an outbound IRC DCC request specifying that port number.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel 'netfilter' firewall software that may allow remote users to access protected hosts in certain situations, depending on the firewall rule set.\nIt is reported that the netfilter connection tracking helper module for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) protocol contains a flaw.  This module is designed to monitor outgoing DCC CHAT/SEND requests and issue 'conntrack expectations' about the pending inbound DCC connections.  According to the report, the conntrack expectation is less precise than it should be, causing unwanted ports for inbound connections to be opened on the firewall.\n\nThe conntrack expectation is reportedly described by a 5-tuple (layer 4 protocol, source ip, source port, destination ip, destination port) and a mask that indicates the parts of the tuple that must match for a new connection to be accepted.  An implementation bug apparently causes the mask to be too wide in specifying the destination IP address (allowing any destination IP instead of a specific one).  As a result, incoming connection requests are only matched on the destination port number and not the destination IP address. \n\nThe vendor credits Jozsef Kadlecsik with discovering this bug.",
    "Impact'": "The impact reportedly depends on the ruleset in effect on the firewall.  In some cases (with, for example, a permissive \"-m state --state RELATED -j ACCEPT\" rule), a remote user may be able to traverse the firewall on a single port number to any destination IP address behind the firewall as soon as a user on the inside of the firewall issues an outbound IRC DCC request specifying that port number.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel ptrace function.  A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root level privileges, gaining root level access on the host.\nPtrace can be used by a non-privileged local user to attach a suid binary as a tracing process, where the set user id (suid) bit of the attached child will be honored, allowing the local user to execute commands with suid root privileges.\n\nThe following steps can be used to trigger the vulnerability.  A non-privileged parent process uses ptrace() to attach a non-privileged child process.  The parent process executes a suid function (such as newgrp) and then the child process follows with an execve() call to any suid function.  It is reported that the property of \"having an ptrace-attached child\" survives the execve() call.  Because the parent process (i.e., the tracer process) has root privileges at this point (via the suid bit), it can trace the child process.  Then, the parent process executes a shell, which is still able to control the child process with ptrace.  This shell can insert arbitrary code into the address space of the child process, where the code will be executed with root privileges (via the child's suid status).\n\nFor a local user to exploit this vulnerability, a suid root binary that will exec a user-defined binary (or shell) is required.  For example, the kernel flaw can be exploited using the newgrp() function.  It is reported that the following conditions must be met for this to be exploitable:\n\n1) /usr/bin/newgrp must be suid root\n2) /usr/bin/newgrp must be world-executable\n3) /usr/bin/newgrp should not prompt for password when run with no arguments.\n\nIt is reported that these conditions are are satisfied by most of the popular Linux distributions.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Sourc Message.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel ptrace function.  A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root level privileges, gaining root level access on the host.\nPtrace can be used by a non-privileged local user to attach a suid binary as a tracing process, where the set user id (suid) bit of the attached child will be honored, allowing the local user to execute commands with suid root privileges.\n\nThe following steps can be used to trigger the vulnerability.  A non-privileged parent process uses ptrace() to attach a non-privileged child process.  The parent process executes a suid function (such as newgrp) and then the child process follows with an execve() call to any suid function.  It is reported that the property of \"having an ptrace-attached child\" survives the execve() call.  Because the parent process (i.e., the tracer process) has root privileges at this point (via the suid bit), it can trace the child process.  Then, the parent process executes a shell, which is still able to control the child process with ptrace.  This shell can insert arbitrary code into the address space of the child process, where the code will be executed with root privileges (via the child's suid status).\n\nFor a local user to exploit this vulnerability, a suid root binary that will exec a user-defined binary (or shell) is required.  For example, the kernel flaw can be exploited using the newgrp() function.  It is reported that the following conditions must be met for this to be exploitable:\n\n1) /usr/bin/newgrp must be suid root\n2) /usr/bin/newgrp must be world-executable\n3) /usr/bin/newgrp should not prompt for password when run with no arguments.\n\nIt is reported that these conditions are are satisfied by most of the popular Linux distributions.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Sourc Message.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel ptrace function.  A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root level privileges, gaining root level access on the host.\nPtrace can be used by a non-privileged local user to attach a suid binary as a tracing process, where the set user id (suid) bit of the attached child will be honored, allowing the local user to execute commands with suid root privileges.\n\nThe following steps can be used to trigger the vulnerability.  A non-privileged parent process uses ptrace() to attach a non-privileged child process.  The parent process executes a suid function (such as newgrp) and then the child process follows with an execve() call to any suid function.  It is reported that the property of \"having an ptrace-attached child\" survives the execve() call.  Because the parent process (i.e., the tracer process) has root privileges at this point (via the suid bit), it can trace the child process.  Then, the parent process executes a shell, which is still able to control the child process with ptrace.  This shell can insert arbitrary code into the address space of the child process, where the code will be executed with root privileges (via the child's suid status).\n\nFor a local user to exploit this vulnerability, a suid root binary that will exec a user-defined binary (or shell) is required.  For example, the kernel flaw can be exploited using the newgrp() function.  It is reported that the following conditions must be met for this to be exploitable:\n\n1) /usr/bin/newgrp must be suid root\n2) /usr/bin/newgrp must be world-executable\n3) /usr/bin/newgrp should not prompt for password when run with no arguments.\n\nIt is reported that these conditions are are satisfied by most of the popular Linux distributions.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Sourc Message.",

    "Title": "(Mandrake Issues Revised Fix for 2.2 Kernel) Linux Kernel Nested Symlink Dereferencing Flaw Lets Local Users Deny Service to Other Processes on the Host",
    "SecurityTracker Alert ID": "1002786",
    "SecurityTracker URL": "http://securitytracker.com/id/1002786",
    "CVE Reference": "GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH",
    "Date": "Nov 21 2001",
    "Impact": "Denial of service via local system",
    "Fix Available": "Yes",
    "Vendor Confirmed": "Yes",
    "Version(s)": "2.2.x (through 2.2.19); 2.4.x (through 2.4.9)",
    "Description": "A local denial of service vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel.  A local user can create deeply nested symbolic links that will force the kernel to consume processing cycles attempting to dereference the symlink, preventing other processes from running.\nA local user can create a deeply nested series of symlinks.  Then, when the user issues the Linux command 'head' on the file name, the kernel will reportedly block the scheduler while attempting to dereference the file name.  As a result, other processes will be prevented from running for up to several hours or more, depending on the depth of nesting.\n\nIt is reported that in kernel version 2.4.10 partially fixed this problem, preventing the scheduler from being blocked but not permitting the rogue process to be killed.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Source Message.",
    "Impact'": "A local user can cause a process to consume all processing resources and prevent other processes from running.",
    "Solution": "The vendor has released a revised fix for the 2.2 kernel.  This also includes a fix for the TCP SYN cookie flaw, described in a separate alert.  The vendor notes that this update is *not* meant to be done via MandrakeUpdate.  Instead, download the necessary RPMs and upgrade manually by following these steps:\n\n   1.  Type: rpm -ivh kernel-[version].i586.rpm\n   2.  Type: mv kernel-[version].i586.rpm /tmp\n   3.  Type: rpm -Fvh *.rpm\n   4a. You may wish to edit /etc/lilo.conf to ensure a new entry is in\n       place.  The new kernel will be the last entry.  Change any options\n       you need to change.  You will also want to create a new entry with\n       the initrd and image directives pointing to the old kernel's\n       vmlinuz and initrd images so you may also boot from the old\n       images if required.\n   4b. PPC users must execute some additional instructions.  First edit\n       /etc/yaboot.conf and add a new entry for the kernel and change\n       any options that you need to change.  You must also create a new\n       initrd image to enable USB support for keyboards and mice by\n       typing: \n         mkinitrd --with=usb-ohci /boot/initrd-2.2.19-20.1mdk 2.2.19-20.1mdk\n   5a. If you use lilo, type: /sbin/lilo -v\n   5b. If you use GRUB, type: sh /boot/grub/install.sh\n   5c. PPC users must type: /sbin/ybin -v\n\nYou may then reboot and use the new kernel and remove the older kernel when you are comfortable using the upgraded one.\n\nLinux-Mandrake

    "SecurityTracker Alert ID": "1002785",

    "CVE Reference": "GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH",
    "Date": "Nov 21 2001",
    "Impact": "Host/resource access via network",
    "Fix Available": "Yes",
    "Vendor Confirmed": "Yes",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux Kernel's firewalling of SYN packets when kernel syn cookie support is enabled.  A remote user could access protected ports in certain limited cases.\nIt is reported that if syn cookies are enabled and being sent by the kernel (as would happen during a TCP SYN flood attack, for example), a remote user may be able to connect to certain firewalled ports that are protected by firewall rules filtering SYN packets.\n\nBecause of the syn cookies, the remote user is not required to send SYN packets to initiate the connection, only ACK packets are needed but with the restriction that the magic cookie is correct.  A remote user can attempt to brute force guess the correct magic cookie by exploring approximately 16 million values (2^24).  This can apparently be achieved within a few hours time against a server with a fast network connection.\n\nThis flaw was reportedly discovered by Manfred Spraul and patched by Andi Kleen from SuSE.",
    "Impact'": "If syn cookies are enabled and being sent, a remote user can attempt to guess a valid magic cookie and connect to a protected (firewalled) port.",
    "Solution": "The vendor has released a fix.  The vendor notes that this update is *not* meant to be done via MandrakeUpdate.  Instead, download the necessary RPMs and upgrade manually by following these steps:\n\n   1.  Type: rpm -ivh kernel-[version].i586.rpm\n   2.  Type: mv kernel-[version].i586.rpm /tmp\n   3.  Type: rpm -Fvh *.rpm\n   4a. You may wish to edit /etc/lilo.conf to ensure a new entry is in\n       place.  The new kernel will be the last entry.  Change any options\n       you need to change.  You will also want to create a new entry with\n       the initrd and image directives pointing to the old kernel's\n       vmlinuz and initrd images so you may also boot from the old\n       images if required.\n   4b. PPC users must execute some additional instructions.  First edit\n       /etc/yaboot.conf and add a new entry for the kernel and change\n       any options that you need to change.  You must also create a new\n       initrd image to enable USB support for keyboards and mice by\n       typing: \n         mkinitrd --with=usb-ohci /boot/initrd-2.2.19-20.1mdk 2.2.19-20.1mdk\n   5a. If you use lilo, type: /sbin/lilo -v\n   5b. If you use GRUB, type: sh /boot/grub/install.sh\n   5c. PPC users must type: /sbin/ybin -v\n\nYou may then reboot and use the new kernel and remove the older kernel when you are comfortable using the upgraded one.\n\nLinux-Mandrake

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Linux Kernel's firewalling of SYN packets when kernel syn cookie support is enabled.  A remote user could access protected ports in certain limited cases.\nIt is reported that if syn cookies are enabled and being sent by the kernel (as would happen during a TCP SYN flood attack, for example), a remote user may be able to connect to certain firewalled ports that are protected by firewall rules filtering SYN packets.\n\nBecause of the syn cookies, the remote user is not required to send SYN packets to initiate the connection, only ACK packets are needed but with the restriction that the magic cookie is correct.  A remote user can attempt to brute force guess the correct magic cookie by exploring approximately 16 million values (2^24).  This can apparently be achieved within a few hours time against a server with a fast network connection.\n\nThis flaw was reportedly discovered by Manfred Spraul and patched by Andi Kleen from SuSE.",

Then, when the user issues the Linux command 'head' on the file name, the kernel will reportedly block the scheduler while attempting to dereference the file name.  As a result, other processes will be prevented from running for up to several hours or more, depending on the depth of nesting.\n\nIt is reported that in kernel version 2.4.10 partially fixed this problem, preventing the scheduler from being blocked but not permitting the rogue process to be killed.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Source Message.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel ptrace function.  A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root level privileges, gaining root level access on the host.\nPtrace can be used by a non-privileged local user to attach a suid binary as a tracing process, where the set user id (suid) bit of the attached child will be honored, allowing the local user to execute commands with suid root privileges.\n\nThe following steps can be used to trigger the vulnerability.  A non-privileged parent process uses ptrace() to attach a non-privileged child process.  The parent process executes a suid function (such as newgrp) and then the child process follows with an execve() call to any suid function.  It is reported that the property of \"having an ptrace-attached child\" survives the execve() call.  Because the parent process (i.e., the tracer process) has root privileges at this point (via the suid bit), it can trace the child process.  Then, the parent process executes a shell, which is still able to control the child process with ptrace.  This shell can insert arbitrary code into the address space of the child process, where the code will be executed with root privileges (via the child's suid status).\n\nFor a local user to exploit this vulnerability, a suid root binary that will exec a user-defined binary (or shell) is required.  For example, the kernel flaw can be exploited using the newgrp() function.  It is reported that the following conditions must be met for this to be exploitable:\n\n1) /usr/bin/newgrp must be suid root\n2) /usr/bin/newgrp must be world-executable\n3) /usr/bin/newgrp should not prompt for password when run with no arguments.\n\nIt is reported that these conditions are are satisfied by most of the popular Linux distributions.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Sourc Message.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel ptrace function.  A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root level privileges, gaining root level access on the host.\nPtrace can be used by a non-privileged local user to attach a suid binary as a tracing process, where the set user id (suid) bit of the attached child will be honored, allowing the local user to execute commands with suid root privileges.\n\nThe following steps can be used to trigger the vulnerability.  A non-privileged parent process uses ptrace() to attach a non-privileged child process.  The parent process executes a suid function (such as newgrp) and then the child process follows with an execve() call to any suid function.  It is reported that the property of \"having an ptrace-attached child\" survives the execve() call.  Because the parent process (i.e., the tracer process) has root privileges at this point (via the suid bit), it can trace the child process.  Then, the parent process executes a shell, which is still able to control the child process with ptrace.  This shell can insert arbitrary code into the address space of the child process, where the code will be executed with root privileges (via the child's suid status).\n\nFor a local user to exploit this vulnerability, a suid root binary that will exec a user-defined binary (or shell) is required.  For example, the kernel flaw can be exploited using the newgrp() function.  It is reported that the following conditions must be met for this to be exploitable:\n\n1) /usr/bin/newgrp must be suid root\n2) /usr/bin/newgrp must be world-executable\n3) /usr/bin/newgrp should not prompt for password when run with no arguments.\n\nIt is reported that these conditions are are satisfied by most of the popular Linux distributions.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Sourc Message.",
    "Impact'": "A local user can execute commands with root level privileges, giving the local user root level access on the host.",
    "Solution": "The vendor has released a fix.  The vendor notes that this update should be performed manually by following these steps:\n\n   1.  Type: rpm -ivh kernel-[version].i586.rpm\n   2.  Type: mv kernel-[version].i586.rpm /tmp\n   3.  Type: rpm -Fvh *.rpm\n   4a. You may wish to edit /etc/lilo.conf to ensure a new entry is in\n       place.  The new kernel will be the last entry.  Change any options\n       you need to change.  You will also want to create a new entry with\n       the initrd and image directives pointing to the old kernel's\n       vmlinuz and initrd images so you may also boot from the old\n       images if required.\n   4b. PPC users must execute some additional instructions.  First edit\n       /etc/yaboot.conf and add a new entry for the kernel and change\n       any options that you need to change.  You must also create a new\n       initrd image to enable USB support for keyboards and mice by\n       typing: \n         mkinitrd --with=usb-ohci /boot/initrd-2.2.19-19.1mdk 2.2.19-19.1mdk\n   5a. Type: /sbin/lilo -v\n   5b. PPC users must type: /sbin/ybin -v\n\nThe packages are available at:\n\nLinux-Mandrake 7.1:\n1fd551f299c93b192feb1189bb6b049e

A local user can create deeply nested symbolic links that will force the kernel to consume processing cycles attempting to dereference the symlink, preventing other processes from running.\nA local user can create a deeply nested series of symlinks.  Then, when the user issues the Linux command 'head' on the file name, the kernel will reportedly block the scheduler while attempting to dereference the file name.  As a result, other processes will be prevented from running for up to several hours or more, depending on the depth of nesting.\n\nIt is reported that in kernel version 2.4.10 partially fixed this problem, preventing the scheduler from being blocked but not permitting the rogue process to be killed.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Source Message.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel ptrace function.  A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root level privileges, gaining root level access on the host.\nPtrace can be used by a non-privileged local user to attach a suid binary as a tracing process, where the set user id (suid) bit of the attached child will be honored, allowing the local user to execute commands with suid root privileges.\n\nThe following steps can be used to trigger the vulnerability.  A non-privileged parent process uses ptrace() to attach a non-privileged child process.  The parent process executes a suid function (such as newgrp) and then the child process follows with an execve() call to any suid function.  It is reported that the property of \"having an ptrace-attached child\" survives the execve() call.  Because the parent process (i.e., the tracer process) has root privileges at this point (via the suid bit), it can trace the child process.  Then, the parent process executes a shell, which is still able to control the child process with ptrace.  This shell can insert arbitrary code into the address space of the child process, where the code will be executed with root privileges (via the child's suid status).\n\nFor a local user to exploit this vulnerability, a suid root binary that will exec a user-defined binary (or shell) is required.  For example, the kernel flaw can be exploited using the newgrp() function.  It is reported that the following conditions must be met for this to be exploitable:\n\n1) /usr/bin/newgrp must be suid root\n2) /usr/bin/newgrp must be world-executable\n3) /usr/bin/newgrp should not prompt for password when run with no arguments.\n\nIt is reported that these conditions are are satisfied by most of the popular Linux distributions.\n\nA demonstration exploit script is included in the Sourc Message.",
