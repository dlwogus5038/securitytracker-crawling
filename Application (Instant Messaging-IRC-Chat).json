A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nThe 'profile.php' and 'profile_misc.php' scripts do not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input in the 'title' and 'content' parameters before displaying the input.  A remote user can create a specially crafted profile that, when viewed by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser.  The code will originate from the site running the PHPOpenChat software and will run in the security context of that site.  As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nThe 'userpage.php' and 'mail.php' scripts are also affected in a similar manner.\n\nThe 'disinvited_chatter' and 'invited_chatter' parameters in 'invite.php' are not properly filtered.

A remote server can also cause the Gaim client to crash.\nThe vendor reported that a remote groupware server can send specially crafted messages to a target client to trigger a memory allocation integer overflow [CVE: CVE-2004-0754].  The resulting heap overflow may allow arbitrary code to be executed.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted URL that, when received by the target user, will overflow a static buffer of 2048 bytes [CVE: CVE-2004-0785].\n\nIt is also reported that a hostname lookup overflow can be triggered [CVE: CVE-2004-0785].  If the DNS server returns a hostname that is greater than MAXHOSTNAMELEN bytes, a buffer overflow will occur.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can create an invalid rich text format (RTF) message to trigger one of several buffer overflows [CVE: CVE-2004-0785].\n\nIt is also reported that a remote web server can return a large HTTP Content-Length header value to cause the target user's Gaim to crash.  This can be triggered if the supplied length value is large enough to cause Gaim to consume all available memory.  This can occur when Gaim reads profile information on some protocols and when smiley themes are installed via drag and drop.\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=2\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=3\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=4\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=5\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=6",

Arbitrary code can be executed on the target user's system with the privileges of the user running the xchat process.\n\nThe vendor credits tsifra with discovering this bug.",

Some of the vulnerabilities require a man-in-the-middle attack to exploit.\n\nSeveral of the vulnerabilities were due to buffer overflows in the processing of Yahoo! Messenger protocol.\n\nAn integer overflow was reported in the processing of the AIM/Oscar protocol.\n\nA variety of other protocols and functions also contain overflows.\n\nIt is reported that two buffer overflows reside in the decoding of octal values in the yahoo_decode() function in \n'gaim/src/protocols/yahoo/yahoo.c' [CVE: CVE-2004-0005].  Only version 0.75 is affected.\n\nA remote server can send an HTTP reply header with specially crafted cookie values to trigger an overflow in 'gaim/src/protocols/yahoo/yahoo.c' in the yahoo_web_pending() function [CVE: CVE-2004-0006].\n\nTwo buffer overflows in yahoo_login_page_hash() can be triggered by specially crafted values in the Yahoo! login webpage [CVE: CVE-2004-0006].\n\nA remote user can send a Yahoo! Messenger packet containing a specially crafted keyname value to the target server via the Yahoo! server to execute arbitrary code on the target system [CVE: CVE-2004-0006].  The flaw reportedly resides in the yahoo_packet_read() function in 'gaim/src/protocols/yahoo/yahoo.c'.\n\nIt is reported that a malicious AIM/Oscar directIM packet can trigger an overflow in the handlehdr_odc() function in 'gaim/src/protocols/oscar/ft.c' [CVE: CVE-2004-0008].  Versions 0.74 and prior are affected.\n\nTwo vulnerabilites were reported in the MIME decoding functions of quotedp_decode() in 'gaim/src/util.c' [CVE: CVE-2004-0005].  Only version 0.75 is affected.\n\nThe gaim_url_parse() function in 'gaim/src/util.c' reportedly splits URLs into fixed sized buffers [CVE: CVE-2004-0006].\n\nThe gaim_markup_extract_info_field() function in 'gaim/src/util.c' contains a stack overflow in several locations [CVE: CVE-2004-0007].  Versions 0.74 and earlier are affected.\n\nA remote user acting as an HTTP proxy server can trigger an overflow in a connected Gaim client when the client is configured to use an HTTP proxy [CVE: CVE-2004-0006].  The flaw resides in the http_canread() function in 'gaim/src/proxy.c'.\n\nThe vendor was initially notified regarding the first of the bugs on January 4, 2004.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012004.html",

A remote server can also cause the Gaim client to crash.\nThe vendor reported that a remote groupware server can send specially crafted messages to a target client to trigger a memory allocation integer overflow [CVE: CVE-2004-0754].  The resulting heap overflow may allow arbitrary code to be executed.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted URL that, when received by the target user, will overflow a static buffer of 2048 bytes [CVE: CVE-2004-0785].\n\nIt is also reported that a hostname lookup overflow can be triggered [CVE: CVE-2004-0785].  If the DNS server returns a hostname that is greater than MAXHOSTNAMELEN bytes, a buffer overflow will occur.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can create an invalid rich text format (RTF) message to trigger one of several buffer overflows [CVE: CVE-2004-0785].\n\nIt is also reported that a remote web server can return a large HTTP Content-Length header value to cause the target user's Gaim to crash.  This can be triggered if the supplied length value is large enough to cause Gaim to consume all available memory.  This can occur when Gaim reads profile information on some protocols and when smiley themes are installed via drag and drop.\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=2\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=3\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=4\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=5\nhttp://gaim.sourceforge.net/security/index.php?id=6",

A remote user can cause the client to crash.\nCore Security Technologies reported six separate flaws.\n\nA format string vulnerability was reported in the ICQ's integrated POP3 e-mail client (in POP3.dll).  A remote user acting as a POP3 server can insert format string characters in the UIDL command response to trigger the flaw and execute arbitrary code on the target user's ICQ client.\n\nIt is also reported that the ICQ \"Features on Demand\" upgrade service can be spoofed.  According to the report, the IP address of the download server and the URLs for the download files are hard-coded in the \"\\DataFiles\\Packages.ini\" file and the system does not use strong authentication or integrity protection mechanisms.  A remote user can spoof the server so that when the target user's client attempts to upgrade, arbitrary code is downloaded and installed on the target user's system.\n\nThe advisory states that the message advertisement service can be spoofed.  A remote user can spoof the server and supply specially crafted HTML to cause the client to crash.\n\nFinally, an input validation vulnerability was reported in the processing of GIF images (in 'icqateimg32.dll').  A remote user can supply a GIF file with a specially crafted header to cause the target user's client to crash.  It is reported that ICQ expects that an existing Global Color Table (GCT) or a Local Color Table (LCT) will follow an \"Image Descriptor\".  If none of the color tables are included, the GIF library will crash.\n\nAdditional technical details are provided in the Source Message and in the original CORE advisory at:\n\nhttp://www.coresecurity.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=315&idxseccion=10\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

A mIRC user could install a remotely-supplied malicious or vulnerable script that will allow a remote user to execute arbitrary code on the system.\nA buffer overflow vulnerability reportedly exists in the $asctime scripting function used to format Unix style time stamps.  A malicious script or vulnerable script (which must be downloaded by the target user) can pass a specially crafted string to the $asctime function to trigger a buffer overflow on the stack and execute arbitrary code.\n\nAccording to the report, the default script included with mIRC does not call the $asctime function.  However, some major scripts available for download will call the $asctime function to decode data provided by the IRC server.\n\nThere are reported to be several forms in which $asctime can be called by a script.  Vulnerable scripts will apparently contain code such as the following, where the '$4' argument is a value supplied by the remote IRC server or other remote source:\n\n//echo 1 uuuppz is idle since $asctime($4)\"\n\nIf the string supplied as the format specifier is longer than 388 bytes, the return address on the stack will reportedly be overwritten.  According to the report, several special characters cannot be used in the string (including ASCII codes 72, 84, 90, 100, 104, 109, 110, 115, 116, 121, 122).\n\nDemonstration exploit code is provided at:\n\nhttp://www.uuuppz.com/research/adv-002-mirc.htm\n\nThe report credits Phrizer (DalNET #KORP) with discovering the flaw.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in Yahoo! Messenger.  A remote user can execute arbitrary code on the another user's computer.\nIt is reported that Yahoo! Messenger allows Java or VisualBasic script execution and also contains some buffer overflows that allow for remote code execution.  A remote user can apparently exploit these flaws to take control of another user's Yahoo! Messenger client or execute code with the privileges of the user running Yahoo! Messenger.\n\nA buffer overflow reportedly exists in the handler for Yahoo! Messenger that processes URLs of the type \"ymsgr\".  Due to the lack of proper bounds checking in the ymsgr protocol,a remote user can create a URL that, when loaded by the target user, will trigger a buffer overflow in the processing of ymsgr \"call\", \"sendim\", \"getimv\", \"chat\", \"addview\", and \"addfriend\" tags.\n\nA remote user can supply a URL with a string that is greater than 260 bytes to cause the client to crash.  WIth 268 bytes, the buffer overflow can be triggered.\n\nThe following is a demonstration exploit URL with 268 bytes of the \"a\" character:\n\nymsgr:call?+<aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...>\n\nSome addition demonstration exploit URLs are reported (requiring an addition 100 bytes to trigger):\n\nymsgr:sendim?+<aaaaaaa..... 368 bytes here>\nymsgr:chat?+<aaaaaaa..... 368 bytes here>\nymsgr:addview?+<aaaaaaa..... 368 bytes here>\nymsgr:addfriend?+<aaaaaaa..... 368 bytes here>\nymsgr:getimv?+<aaaaaaa..... 368 bytes here>\n\nThe author of the report notes that the last URL above was previously disclosed but is included here for completeness.\n\nIn addition to the buffer overflow vulnerabilities, Yahoo! Messenger can be made to execute remotely supplied Java or Visual Basic scripts to allow a remote user to hijack another user's client.  A remote user can create a URL that begins with \"ymsgr:addview?\" to add browser-ready Yahoo! content to the Yahoo! Messenger \"Content Tabs\" for viewing within Yahoo! Messenger.  When the target user loads this URL, malicious scripting code supplied by the remote user can be installed on the target user's computer and then executed by the target user's browser (e.g., Internet Explorer).\n\nThe following demonstration exploit URL will reportedly add a new \"Content Tab\" called \"YIM Cal-Hack\" to the current set of content tabs, then will display a dialogue box with one option (\"OK\"), and then will open the \"YIM Cal-Hack\" content.\n\nymsgr:addview?http://rd.yahoo.com/messenger/?http://viceconsulting.com/cons/servs/infosec/yimvul001/DemH0.htm\n\nInstructions on how to remove the \"YIM Cal-Hack\" content tab are provided in the Source Message.",

Apparently, the client will use the original filename from the \"SRC\" parameter as the temporary file name.  As a result, the AIM server (the peer that is sending the file) can specify a file name that includes directory traversal characters ('../') to cause the file to be saved anywhere on the AIM client host.\n\nIt is also reported that the AIM client only analyzes the first 12 bytes of the file to determine if the file is really a sound file.
