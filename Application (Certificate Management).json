    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in Red Hat Certificate Server.  A remote user may be able to execute arbitrary code.  A local user may be able to obtain elevated privileges.\nA remote user can send a specially crafted request to the Management Console to trigger a stack overflow in the Help buttons on the Admin pages.\n\nOn UNIX-based systems, remote code execution is not possible.\n\nIn some situations, a local user can execute arbitrary code with root level privileges.\n\nPeter Winter-Smith of NGSSoftware discovered this vulnerability.",

    "Description": "Nomad Mobile Research Centre (NMRC) reported a vulnerability in the ValiCert Validation Authority.  A remote user could trigger buffer overflows to gain SYSTEM level access to the Administration Server.  Other flaws are also reported.\nNMRC reports that there are several vulnerabilties in a CGI script used by the Enterprise Validation Authority (VA) Administration Server.  \n\nIt is reported that there are multiple (14) buffer overflows exist in forms.exe remote management CGI script.  A remote user with access to this interface on TCP port 13333 can trigger a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the server.  The code will run with SYSTEM privileges.  The remote user may be required to provide a username and password to exploit this flaw if the administrator requires authentication.  The overflows are described in the Source Message.\n\nA remote user can determine the path of the forms.exe CGI script by providing an invalid extension to a URL GET request.  For example, the following URL adds the invalid 'foobar' extension:\n\nhttp://computer:13333/cgi-bin/forms.exe?extension=foobar&command=Add+Extension\n\nThe server will reportedly return an error page with the following text that discloses the drive letter and the path of the ValiCert application.\n\nThe server reportedly does not provide proper input validation and filtering, allowing cross-site scripting attacks during certificate creation.  If a remote user views the certificate through the ValiCert Administrative server, the HTML is interpreted and any scripting is executed.  For example, HTML code can be inserted by the remote user into the organizational name.  When the certificate is displayed, the arbitrary HTML code will be executed and will appear to originate from the Administrative server.  The remote user may be required to supply a username and password to create such a certificate and trigger the vulnerability.\n\nIt is reported that may issue weak 'random' tokens for communication with Hardware Security Modules.  These are reportedly created using the rand() function, seeded using local system time which is predictable and may not be finite enough to act as a good source of entropy.  Seeding using local system time will apparently guarantee that the generated values will increase linearly.\n\nIn addition, the '/dev/urandom' device is used by default for certificate generation (if the device exists).  This function apparently does not perform blocking when its entropy pool is low. \n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",
