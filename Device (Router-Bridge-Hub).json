This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",

Cisco Industrial Integrated Services Routers is affected.\nA local user can exploit race conditions in CPU data cache processing to obtain potentially sensitive information on the target system. This can be exploited to read arbitrary virtual memory on the target system, including by a local user on a guest operating system of a virtual machine to read arbitrary memory from other guest systems, the host operating system, and the hypervisor.\n\nIn certain cases, a local user can run a specially crafted application to exploit several flaws in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature and leverage CPU data cache timing behavior to infer information or read information from various CPU caches.\n\nA local user that can trigger an out-of-bounds index error in an application can read data from another process from the CPU virtual memory [CVE-2017-5753]. The eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine can be used to create vulnerable code.\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to speculatively execute an indirect branch to leak memory contents from another process into a CPU cache and then read the contents of the cache [CVE-2017-5715].\n\nA local user can run specially crafted code to cause the CPU to read memory from a CPU cache before an asynchronous permission check occurs [CVE-2017-5754]. AMD CPUs are reportedly not affected.\n\nThe Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium product lines are affected.\n\nCPUs from AMD and ARM are also affected.\n\nCPUs from other vendors may also affected.\n\nThe CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 vulnerabilities are referred to as \"Spectre\".\n\nThe CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability is referred to as \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe original advisories are available at:\n\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\nhttps://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n\nPaul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Werner Haas, Mike Hamburg, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher, Michael Schwarz, Yuval Yarom, Anders Fogh, Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero Team, and others reported these vulnerabilities.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in several TCP stack implementations.  A remote user may be able to cause denial of service conditions using a TCP reset attack.  Multiple vendors are affected. Brocade 5600 vRouter is affected.\nThe UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre (NISCC) reported that some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are particularly vulnerable to TCP reset attacks.  A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities.  Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\".  In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated.  Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said.  However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number.  The Associate Press reports that the proper number can be guessed within as few as four attempts, requiring only seconds to achieve.\n\nThe report credits Paul A. Watson for discovering a practical method for conducting TCP reset attacks (presented in \"Slipping In The Window: TCP Reset Attacks\" at the CanSecWest 2004 conference).\n\nThe report indicates that the following vendors are affected [this is not an inclusive list]:\n\n- Cray Inc. is vulnerable on their UNICOS, UNICOS/mk and UNICOS/mp systems\n\n- Check Point is affected, but has issued a protection mechanism in the latest release for VPN-1/FireWall-1 (R55 HFA-03) that can protect both the firewall device and hosts located behind the firewall.\n\n- Internet Initiative Japan, Inc (IIJ) is affected.\n\n- InterNiche NicheStack and NicheLite are affected.\n\n- Juniper Networks products are affected.\n\n- Cisco products are affected, including IOS and non-IOS based devices.\n\nOther vendors are assessing the impact of this flaw.\n\nThe NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 236929 is available at:\n\nhttp://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/236929/index.htm",

Alex Halderman, Viktor Dukhovni, Emilia Kasper, Shaanan Cohney, Susanne Engels, Christof Paar, and Yuval Shavitt reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can create a specially crafted private DSA key that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a double free memory error and cause denial of service conditions [CVE-2016-0705].\n\nAdam Langley (Google/BoringSSL) reported this vulnerability.\n\nA remote user can supply a specially crafted username value to the target SRP server to trigger a memory leak [CVE-2016-0798].\n\nEmilia Kasper of the OpenSSL development team reported this vulnerability.\n\nA user can create specially crafted data (e.g., configuration file) that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a null pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() functions [CVE-2016-0797].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.\n\nA user can create specially crafted data that, when processed by OpenSSL, will trigger a memory error in BIO_*printf() functions [CVE-2016-0799].\n\nGuido Vranken reported this vulnerability.\n\nA local user can conduct a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture to potentially recover RSA keys [CVE-2016-0702].\n\nYuval Yarom, the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin, Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger, University of Pennsylvania, reported this vulnerability.\n\nThe SSLv2 's2_srvr.c' code does not ensure that a clear-key-length value is 0 for non-export ciphers.

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in several TCP stack implementations. A remote user may be able to cause denial of service conditions using a TCP reset attack. Multiple vendors are affected. Juniper Junos is affected.\nThe UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre (NISCC) reported that some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are particularly vulnerable to TCP reset attacks.  A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities.  Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\".  In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated.  Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said.  However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number.  The Associate Press reports that the proper number can be guessed within as few as four attempts, requiring only seconds to achieve.\n\nThe report credits Paul A. Watson for discovering a practical method for conducting TCP reset attacks (presented in \"Slipping In The Window: TCP Reset Attacks\" at the CanSecWest 2004 conference).\n\nThe report indicates that the following vendors are affected [this is not an inclusive list]:\n\n- Cray Inc. is vulnerable on their UNICOS, UNICOS/mk and UNICOS/mp systems\n\n- Check Point is affected, but has issued a protection mechanism in the latest release for VPN-1/FireWall-1 (R55 HFA-03) that can protect both the firewall device and hosts located behind the firewall.\n\n- Internet Initiative Japan, Inc (IIJ) is affected.\n\n- InterNiche NicheStack and NicheLite are affected.\n\n- Juniper Networks products are affected.\n\n- Cisco products are affected, including IOS and non-IOS based devices.\n\nOther vendors are assessing the impact of this flaw.\n\nThe NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 236929 is available at:\n\nhttp://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/236929/index.htm",

In certain cases where no authentication has occured on the device since the last reboot, a remote user that can determine an encryption key used by the device can upload a new configuration to the target device.\n\nThe 'apply.cgi' script contains a buffer overflow [CVE: CVE-2005-2799].

A remote user can exploit this to upload a new configuration to non-volatile memory on the target device.  The new configuration will be loaded the next time the device reboots as long as no newer configuration modifications are made.\n\nThe 'upgrade.cgi' script is affected by the same authentication flaw.\n\nSeveral scripts do not properly process user-supplied POST requests submitted to the management interface.

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in several TCP stack implementations. A remote user may be able to cause denial of service conditions using a TCP reset attack.  HP's ProCurve switches are affected.\nThe UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre (NISCC) reported that some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are particularly vulnerable to TCP reset attacks.  A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities.  Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\".  In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated.  Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said.  However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number.  The Associate Press reports that the proper number can be guessed within as few as four attempts, requiring only seconds to achieve.\n\nThe report credits Paul A. Watson for discovering a practical method for conducting TCP reset attacks (presented in \"Slipping In The Window: TCP Reset Attacks\" at the CanSecWest 2004 conference).\n\nThe report indicates that the following vendors are affected [this is not an inclusive list]:\n\n- Cray Inc. is vulnerable on their UNICOS, UNICOS/mk and UNICOS/mp systems\n\n- Check Point is affected, but has issued a protection mechanism in the latest release for VPN-1/FireWall-1 (R55 HFA-03) that can protect both the firewall device and hosts located behind the firewall.\n\n- Internet Initiative Japan, Inc (IIJ) is affected.\n\n- InterNiche NicheStack and NicheLite are affected.\n\n- Juniper Networks products are affected.\n\n- Cisco products are affected, including IOS and non-IOS based devices.\n\nOther vendors are assessing the impact of this flaw.\n\nThe NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 236929 is available at:\n\nhttp://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/236929/index.htm",

A remote user can cause the device to reload.  Cisco ONS 15454 and 15454E devices configured with an ML-series line card and running release 4.60 are vulnerable, because the release bundles a vulnerable version of IOS.\nCisco reported that a remote user can send certain SNMP requests to the target system to cause the device to reload.

A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities. Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\". In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated. Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said. However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number. The Associate Press reports that the proper number can be guessed within as few as four attempts, requiring only seconds to achieve.\n\nThe report credits Paul A. Watson for discovering a practical method for conducting TCP reset attacks (presented in \"Slipping In The Window: TCP Reset Attacks\" at the CanSecWest 2004 conference).\n\nCisco reported that all Cisco products which contain a TCP stack are susceptible to this vulnerability, including Cisco IOS.\n\nCisco reports that in general, all TCP-based protocols where a TCP connection stays established for longer than one minute should be considered at risk.\n\nFor Cisco IOS, Cisco has assigned Bug ID CSCed27956 and CSCed38527 to this vulnerability.  For Cisco IOS, only TCP sessions terminated on a device are affected.\n\nFor Cisco IOS Firewall (IOS FW), all TCP sessions passing through the Cisco IOS FW are vulnerable, even if the originating and receiving devices themselves are not vulnerable.  Cisco has assigned Bug ID CSCed93836 to this vulnerability.\n\nThe Cisco PSIRT has identified the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as the protocol which has the greatest potential for impact.  This includes both external and internal (eBGP and iBGP) sessions, the report said.  If a BGP session between two routers is interrupted, then all routes that had been advertised between these two peers will be immediately withdrawn.\n\nIf a BGP peering session is interrupted a few times within a short time interval, then BGP route dampening may be invoked (if enabled), the report said.  Affected routes will be removed from the routing table for a default period of 45 minutes.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can cause denial of service on the target TCP session.  For Cisco IOS, only sessions that terminate or are generated at the device are affected.  For Cisco IOS Firewall, all TCP sessions that pass through the device are also affected.",

    "Impact'": "A remote user can cause the router to consume all available CPU resources and all available bandwidth on the network segment.",
    "Solution": "Cisco is working on a solution and has assigned Bug ID CSCdv19648 to this flaw.\n\nThe following workaround has been described:\n\n\"The workaround for this issue is to apply MD5 authentication that will permit the receipt of EIGRP packets only from authorized hosts.  You can find an example of how to configure MD5 authentication for EIGRP at the following URL (possibly wrapped):\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios120/12cgcr/np1_c/1cprt1/1ceigrp.htm#xtocid18\n\nIf you are using EIGRP in the unicast mode then you can mitigate this issue by placing appropriate ACL which will block all EIGRP packets from illegitimate hosts. In the following example the EIGRP neighbor has IP address of 10.0.0.2 and the local router has address 10.0.0.1.\n\nRouter#config t\nRouter(config)#access-list 111 permit eigrp host 10.0.0.2 host 10.0.0.1\nRouter(config)#access-list 111 deny eigrp any host 10.0.0.1\n\nThe previous example will permit all EIGRP packet throughout the router and into the rest of the network. If you want to block these packets as well then use the following commands instead of the previous example:\n\nRouter#config t\nRouter(config)#access-list 111 permit eigrp host 10.0.0.2 host 10.0.0.1\nRouter(config)#access-list 111 deny eigrp any any\n\nAn ACL will not be effective if you are using the default multicast mode of EIGRP neighbor discovery. However, multicast packets should not be propagated through the Internet so an attacker must be on the same local network segment as the target router in order to exploit this issue with multicast advertisements.\"",

ONS Software prior to version 3.4 is affected.\n\nA remote user can gain FTP access to the control cards using any non-existent username and password.  Then, the remote user can upload modified configuration files and delete software images from the TCC, TCC+ or XTC.\n\nThe running image database of the TCC, TCC+ or XTC stores usernames and passwords in clear text.  A local user with access to the backup of the image database can view usernames and passwords.  Also, (separately) a remote user can analyze an offline database backup of the TCC, TCC+ or XTC to view username and password pairs. If the remote user can obtain the administrator password, the remote user can gain complete control over the Cisco ONS platform.\n\nA remote user can use the default \"public\" SNMP community string to gain SNMP access to the TCC, TCC+ or XTC.  Apparently, this string cannot be changed in the ONS software.\n\nA remote user can request an invalid CORBA Interoperable Object Reference (IOR) via HTTP to potentially cause the TCC, TCC+ or XTC to reset.\n\nA remote user can send an HTTP request that begins with a character other than '/' to possibly cause the TCC, TCC+, TCCi or XTC to reset.\n\nA remote user can use a default username and password to telnet to the TCC, TCC+ and XTC and access to the underlying VxWorks Operating System and gain complete control over the Cisco ONS platform.  Apparently, the password for this default account cannot be changed and the account cannot be disabled.\n\nA remote user may use the SNMP read-only community string to view potentially sensitive system information in the SNMP MIBs on the TCC, TCC+ or XTC.\n\nCisco reports that the following hardware is *not* affected:  Cisco ONS15540 extended service platform, ONS15800 series, ONS15200 series metro DWDM systems, and the ONS15194 IP transport concentrator.\n\nCisco has assigned Cisco bug ID CSCds52295, CSCdt84146, CSCdv62307, CSCdw15690, CSCdx82962 and CSCdy70756 to these vulnerabilities.",

    "Solution": "Cisco reports that the vulnerable versions (11.1, 11.2, and 11.3) are at 'End of Life' and will not be fixed.  Cisco recommends using one of the two following workarounds:\n\nA) Disable the TFTP server entirely.\n\nCisco IOS provides TFTP server functionality to facilitate the transfer of Cisco IOS images when another TFTP server may not be available. If the TFTP server functionality is not currently needed, the following steps may be taken to disable the TFTP server.\n\n1. While in enable mode on the router, issue the command \"show running-config\" and look for lines starting with \"tftp-server\".\n\n2. For each line in the config starting with \"tftp-server\", prepend the word \"no\" followed by a space followed by the full text of the matching line in config mode to remove that entry. This step must be repeated for each matching line of the config.\n\n3. Once this task has been completed, verify that there are no lines starting with \"tftp-server\" by issuing the command \"show running-config\" from the enable prompt.\n\n4. Once verified, save the new configuration so that the server will be disabled upon the next reset of the device.\n\nB) Provide aliases for TFTP server filenames\n\nCisco IOS provides the ability to alias a long filename to a shorter filename.  If the tftp-server entries in the configuration have the keyword \"alias\" in them, the router will not be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability.  To implement this workaround, follow the directions above for disabling the TFTP server, and then add any configuration lines back to the config by appending the keyword \"alias\" followed by a short filename such that the command resembles:\n\n    tftp-server flash rsp-jv-mz.111-24a alias CiscoIOS \n\nNote that this must be done for every line starting with \"tftp-server\" in the configuration. The existence of a single line in the configuration beginning with \"tftp-server\" without an alias defined while running affected versions of software is all that is needed to become subject to this vulnerability.",

    "Description": "Cisco reported a vulnerability in the Cisco uBR7200 series and uBR7100 series Universal Broadband Routers.   A remote user could bypass the authentication mechanism and load an alternate configuration onto the cable modem.  A cable modem customer could exploit this to gain higher bandwidth service, for example.\nCisco reported that a remote user can create a truncated, invalid configuration file that will be improperly accepted as valid by the router.  If the file does not contain an integrity verification authentication code, the router will incorrectly load the configuration and become operational.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to a defect in Cisco IOS Software running on a cable modem termination system (CMTS) combined with a weakness in an industry-standard cable modem specification.\n\nWhen a cable modem is initialized, the modem will attempt to obtain a configuration file from the cable provider's network using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) over the external (cable) interface.  The industry's Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) cable modem specification requires that this configuration also be downloadable via the internal interface (Ethernet).  Because of this DOCSIS requirement, a user on the internal interface could create a TFTP server with the same IP address of the cable provider's TFTP server to load an alternate configuration file.\n\nThe DOCSIS configuration file includes an MD5-based 'Message Integrity Check (MIC)' hash of the configuration data.  If a cable modem configuration file MIC fails to correctly verify, the modem should fail to become operational.\n\nAccording to the report, the uBR7200 and uBR7100 series routers fail to perform the MD5 verification if the DOCSIS configuration file does not contain a MIC value.  A remote user can take a valid configuration file and can edit various fields and truncate the file just before the MIC entry.  Then, the router will load this file and, due to the vulnerability, will begin operation.\n\nCisco has assigned bug ID CSCdx72740 to this vulnerability.\n\nCisco reports that their Cisco uBR10000 series Universal Broadband Routers are not affected by this vulnerability.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can change the configuration of the device.  This could be used, for example, to switch the router's level of service to a higher level (e.g., increased bandwidth).",

For the exact fixed version number that is applicable to your release, see the table in the Source Message or refer to the Vendor URL for the vendor's advisory.\n\nA new Cisco IOS configuration command 'cable tftp-enforce' has been introduced (reference CSCdx57688) to prohibit a cable modem from registering and becoming operational if there is no matching TFTP traffic via the CMTS preceding the registration attempt.  This new command is available on the uBR10012 router as well as the uBR7200 and uBR7100 series.  To correct the flaw in the uBR7100 and uBR7200 series routers, both this new cable tftp-enforce command feature *and* the fix for the MD5 authentication bypass are required.\n\nCisco has provided the following guidance for obtaining the fix:\n\nCustomers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their regular update channels.

This sets up a static NAT rule that redirects traffic entering WAN interface. Then, you must also enter the command ``save'' to save your configuration to NVRAM.  You can optionally check the status of the NAT table by issuing ``show auto''. If you made some mistake, you can ``del auto <number>'', and then retry.

    "Description": "A denial of service vulnerability was reported in certain versions of Cisco's IOS router operating system.\nThree denial of service issues were reported.\n\nIn the first issue, a remote user can reportedly conduct a full port scan of all 65535 ports through a Cisco 2611 router (tested on C2600-IO3-M, Version 12.1(6.5)) to cause the router to ultimately crash.  This can reportedly be achieved using namp (full connect/half connect/null/fin/ack/xmas).  A remote user can also scan a class C network against a single open port to cause the router to crash.  \n\nAccording to the report, the router CPU utilization will reach 90 - 100% and the router will fail to respond.  The report states that this flaw is not the same as the recently reported Cisco Bug ID CSCds07326i (which involved scans directed at the router).\n\nFor the second denial of service issue, it is reported that some versions of IOS leave UDP port 1985 open even when HSRP is not running.  A remote user can flood this port with randomly sized UDP packets to cause CPU utilization to exceed 90% and to eventually cause the router to crash.\n\nThe following versions may be affected:\n\n12.1(8a)E5 Catalyst 6k R700, 11.2(23) C2500-I-L, 12.2(2)XI (c827), 12.1(9) (C2500-I-L), 11.1(16) (c1000), 12.0(4)XM (c805), 12.2(2)T1 (C2600-IK8O3S);\n\nRegarding the third denial of service issue, it is reported that the 12.1.x IOS implementation of HSRP fails to check the IP address of the phantom router against the IP address of the interface on which HSRP is running when the IP is advertised from a remote host using IRPAS.  As a result, a potential processing loop can be created.  IOS may incorrectly assign the phantom router an IP address of a local interface through which packets enter the Active router.\n\nA demonstration exploit example is provided:\n\n./hsrp -d 192.168.1.253 -v 192.168.1.254 -a cisco -g 1 -i eth0 \nwhere 192.168.1.253 - IP of a phantom router, 192.168.1.254 - IP of an active router interface on which the standby 1 ip 192.168.1.253 command is configured.  In this case, the router goes into standby and 192.168.1.254 is taken as a phantom's IP. \n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

A remote user can conduct denial of service attacks, crack administrative passwords, and, when in a certain configuration, hijack administrative connections.\n@stake issued an advisory warning that there are multiple vulnerabilities that may allow a remote user on the wired or wireless side of the device to attempt to locate the device, cause loss of administration functionality, or gain administrative access to the device.\n\nIt is reported that the device's management web server is accessible by any host and there are no access control lists.  Access to this interface is only protected by a password transmitted over an unencrypted connection.  The passwords are case insensitive and have a maximum length of 16 characters, making it more feasible for a remote user to conduct a brute force password guessing attempt.\n\nA remote user can connect to the web interface and enter a long string for the administration password.  After clicking the 'OK' button, a connect error will occur and the web server will crash.  A hard (physical) restart is required to return the server to normal operations.\n\nThe device apparently includes a TFTP server that cannot be disabled.  A remote user can readily conduct a password guessing attack using this interface with the following type of scripted command:\n\ntftp -i 192.168.1.1 get FLASH_Database-<password>\n\nThe device also uses a weak authentication mechanism for the administrative web interface.  When an administrator accesses the device and successfully authenticates, the administrator's IP address is then used for subsequent session authentication.  If the administrator has connected to the device via a proxy server or via a device that performs address translation, it is feasible for another user to hijack the session.  Because the device does not request the existing password when changing passwords, a remote user that has hijacked (or piggybacked) a session can change the administrative password to gain administrative control of the device.\n\nA remote user on the local network can reportedly listen on port 8887 for a UDP broadcast to determine the device's current name, IP address, netmask, serial number, and aerial address.\n\nA remote user that is 'bonded' can cause denial of service conditions.  A remote user can bond and then connect using the device and supply a long username for the PPP username.  This will apparently cause the device to disallow future connection attempts.",

According to the report, more recent versions of IOS limit the table to 16000 redirects, thereby limiting the maximum memory consumption that can be caused by this exploit.\n\nIt is reported that a remote user may be able to cause an IOS device to stop routing or to deny access to the console.\n\nA demonstration exploit transcript that uses the 'icmp_redflod' tool (available at http://www.phenoelit.de/irpas/icmp_redflod.c) is provided:\n\n\tlinuxbox# cd /where/irpas/is\n\tlinuxbox# make libpackets.a\n\tlinuxbox# gcc -o icmp_redflod -I. -L. icmp_redflod.c -lpackets\n\tlinuxbox# ./icmp_redflod -i eth0 -D <destination_ip> -G <fake_gateway>\n\nIt is reported that several versions of Cisco IOS are affected:\n\n\t\tCisco 1005\tIOS 11.0(18)\n\t\tCisco 1603\tIOS 11.3(11b)\n\t\tCisco 1603\tIOS 12.0(3)\n\t\tCisco 2503\tIOS 11.0(22a)\n\t\tCisco 2503\tIOS 11.1(24a)\n\nAccording to the report, the following versions are not affected:\n\n\t\tCisco 1603\tIOS 12.1(11)\n\t\tCisco 1603\tIOS 12.2(5)\n\t\tCisco 2503\tIOS 11.2(26a)\n\t\tCisco 2503\tIOS 11.3(11b)\n\t\tCisco 2503\tIOS 12.0(19)\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

    "Solution": "The vendor has released a fix, as described in an earlier alert. For more information on the fix, see the Cisco advisory:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/catos-telrcv-vuln-pub.shtml\n\nCisco has provided the following workarounds for the CatOS Telnet buffer overflow vulnerability:\n\n1) Disable Telnet and use ssh instead (if ssh is available in the code base you are using).  For instructions, see:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ssh_cat_switches.html\n\n 2) User \"IP Permit List\" for Telnet to restrict access to the management interface to authorized and trusted IP addresses.  This reportedly will not prevent spoofed packets from reaching the interface.\n\nFor instructions, see:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat5000/rel_6_3/config/ip_perm.htm\n\n3)  On the Catalyst 6000 series switches, use a VLAN Access Control List (ACL), if that feature is available, instead of using the IP Permit List workaround above.   Cisco notes that this, too, will not prevent spoofed IP packets from reaching the interface.\n\nFor instructions, see:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat6000/sft_6_1/configgd/acc_list.htm\n\n4) Assign all of the management interfaces of all the switches in the network to a unique VLAN and apply access control lists on the router switching between the VLANs. \n\nFor an example, see:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat6000/sft_6_1/configgd/acc_list.htm\n\n5) Apply access control lists on routers, switches, and firewalls sitting in front of the CatOS switches to block Telnet access (port 23) from reaching the management interface.\n\nFor an example, see:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat6000/sft_6_1/configgd/acc_list.htm",

    "Description": "A configuration vulnerability was reported in some ZyXEL Prestige routers that allows remote users to access the router's Telnet and FTP services in the default configuration.\nIn the default configuration, the P642R and P642R-I ADSL routers have the administrative Telnet and FTP services exposed on the WAN (Internet) side.  In addition, a common default password is used.  It is reported that a significant proportion of users do not change the default password.  This allows a remote user to access the device and make modifications to the device's configuration and firmware.\n\nSince the release of firmware version AJ.3, WAN side filters for Telnet and FTP are apparently intended to be in place in the default configuration.  However, that is not the case.\n\nIt is reported that the ZyXEL Prestige 642M is not vulnerable.\n\nThe P642R and 642R-I models when used in \"bridge mode\" with PPPoE are reported to be not vulnerable.",

    "Solution": "Users can apply the FTP_WAN and TELNET_WAN filter rules to block incoming connections to ports 21 and 23.  This can reportedly be done by hooking filter rules 3 and 5 into the Remote Node Setup (menu 11.1 -> 11.5), like so:\n\n                         Menu 11.5 - Remote Node Filter\n\n                    Input Filter Sets:\n                      protocol filters=3,5\n                        device filters=\n                    Output Filter Sets:\n                      protocol filters=\n                        device filters=",

The vulnerability only exists in certain routing configurations.\nCisco reports that router configurations that include BGP4 Prefix Filtering with Inbound Route Maps are vulnerable.\n\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) update messages contain Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and attributes that describe the appropriate network path to the destination.  Each path attribute is composed of a type, length, and value (TLV) object.  If a BGP update message that contains an unrecognized transitive attribute is received, it can cause failures in Cisco IOS routers.\n\nCisco reports that this vulnerability is due to memory corruption.\n\nCisco devices that may be running with affected Cisco IOS software releases include:\n\nCisco routers in the AGS/MGS/CGS/AGS+, IGS, RSM, 800, ubr900, 1000, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 2500, 2600, 3000, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4500, 4700, AS5200, AS5300, AS5800, 6400, 7000, 7200, ubr7200, 7500, and 12000 series.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned Cisco bug ID CSCdt79947.\n\nThe following versions of Cisco IOS are *not* vulnerable:\n\nSoftware based on 12.1, 12.0(5)T, 12.2, 12.0ST, and 12.1(E).\n\nAlso, non-IOS products are not vulnerable.",

Once this has occurred, the device requires a cold reboot (power cycle) to return to normal operation. \n\nThe vendor makes recommendations for the affected platforms (BinTec X1000, BinTec X1200, BinTec X4000) -- see the \"solution\" section.\n\nThe vendor notes that systems with the following properties are *NOT* affected: VPN license activated, or port 1723/tcp blocked for all interfaces.",

    "Solution": "The vendor will fix this vulnerability in the next release.  In the meantime, the vendor recommends the following:\n\n\"that you block all unused ports and update to the latest system software.  In any case, port 1723/tcp should be closed for all interfaces on systems without VPN license.  You can block the ports either by using the access lists of the router or by activating NAT.\"",

The PPTP daemon is the source of the vulnerability.  It is intended to be activated only when the appropriate software license key is entered, but this process is not working properly.  As a result, when the ostensibly deactivated PPTP daemon receives a TCP SYN packet, the process will consum all CPU resources.\n\nIt is reported that routers that are configured with the additional VPN software license are not vulnerable and routers that filter tcp port 1723 are not vulnerable.",
