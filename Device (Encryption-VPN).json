A remote user can cause the device to reload or to stop processing traffic.  A certain configuration may cause the device to pass unauthorized packets through the device.\nAn internal authentication bug was reported.  A remote user could login via IPSec using a group account username and password of another group account on the device in a certain situation, such as when no user accounts are configured.\n\nA remote user can submit a long HTTP GET request to the device's web interface to cause the concentrator to temporarily stop processing traffic while the CPU utilization reaches 100% for approximately five minutes.\n\nA remote user can query the device via SSH, FTP, or HTTP to obtain information about the device.  \n\nA remote user can cause the concentrator to reload by connecting via PPTP with the 'No Encryption' option if the concentrator has encryption set.\n\nA remote user can also submit a web form with large strings for the username and password to cause the device to reload.\n\nA remote user with a VPN client can also submit a large string in response to the username prompt to cause the device to reload.\n\nA remote user can send various malformed or large ISAKMP protocol packets to the device to cause the device to reload.\n\nThe system reportedly discloses some administrative passwords in clear text in the source of HTML pages provided to authenticated remote administrative users.  An authenticated remote administrative user may be able to view a password even if they don't have the appropriate level of administrative access.\n\nA remote authenticated administrative user may be able to view the unencrypted certificate password in the HTML source of the Certificate Management HTML pages.\n\nWhen configured in a certain manner, the VPN Concentrator may allow any protocol on any port to pass through the device.  If the XML filter configuration option is enabled on the public interface, a certain rule is added but with an incorrect protocol value.  The rule \"HTTPS on Public Inbound (XML-Auto)(forward/in)\" is reportedly added with a correct destination port of \"443\" and an incorrect protocol value of \"ANY\".  However, the device only checks destination ports when the protocol value is TCP or UDP, so this setting apparently lets any protocol through on any port.\n\nA remote user can obtain certain limited information via the concentrator's web interface without providing valid authentication credentials.\n\nA flaw was reported in the LAN-to-LAN IPSec tunneling feature.  The device does not verify that data from a LAN-to-LAN connection is originating from the correct network.\n\nAffected platforms include the 3005, 3015, 3030, 3060, 3080, and the Cisco VPN 3002 Hardware Client.  The VPN Client software is not affected.
