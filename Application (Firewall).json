Check Point Provider-1 is affected.\nThe UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre (NISCC) reported that some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are particularly vulnerable to TCP reset attacks.  A remote user can cause TCP sessions to terminate prematurely, causing denial of service conditions.\n\nThe specific impact on applications that use TCP depends on the mechanisms built into the application to address premature TCP session termination.\n\nAccording to the report, NISCC considers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be one of the most affected applications, as it relies on a persistent TCP session between BGP peer entities.  Premature termination of an underlying TCP session may require routing tables to be rebuilt and may cause \"route flapping\".  In the case of BGP, using the TCP MD5 Signature Option and anti-spoofing measures can mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nOther applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and (Secure Sockets Layer) SSL based applications may also be affected, but to a lesser degree, the report said.\n\nA remote user can reportedly send a TCP packet with the RST (reset) flag set (or the SYN flag) with the appropriate spoofed source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports to cause the TCP session to be terminated.  Ordinarily, the remote user may have the probability of 1 in 2^32 of guessing the correct sequence number, the report said.  However, in actuality, a remote user may be able to guess an appropriate sequence number with much greater probability because many implementations will accept any sequence number within a certain window of the expected sequence number.

A remote user can cause denial of service conditions or execute arbitrary code on the target system.\neEye Digital Security reported that a remote user can execute arbitrary code on the target system in the default installation.  A remote user can also cause \"severe\" denial-of-service conditions on the target system.\n\nIt is reported that a remote user send a single specially crafted NetBIOS Name Service packet to UDP port 137 on the target system to cause arbitrary code to be executed with kernel-level privileges on the target system [CVE: CVE-2004-0444].  When such a packet is received and has a source port of 137 and if the software is configured to allow incoming NetBIOS packets on port 137 (not a default setting, but may be required to permit Windows file sharing), the flaw can reportedly be triggered.  The flaw resides in the SYMDNS.SYS driver, the report said.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a single specially crafted DNS response packet to the target system on UDP port 53 with a source port of 53 to cause the target system to enter an infinite processing loop, requiring a cold reboot to return to normal operations [CVE: CVE-2004-0445].  The flaw resides in the SYMDNS.SYS, where a compressed name pointer that points to itself can trigger the flaw.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send specially crafted NetBIOS Name Service response packets to trigger a heap overflow in SYMDNS.SYS and execute arbitrary code with Ring 0 kernel privileges [CVE: CVE-2004-0444].  Some exploitation attempts may result in denial of service conditions (blue screen), but it is also possible to execute arbitrary code.\n\nIt is also reported that a remote user can send a DNS Resource Record with a long canonical name (CNAME) field to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code with Ring 0 kernel level privileges on the target system [CVE: CVE-2004-0444].  The report indicates that this vulnerability can be exploited even if all ports are filtered and/or all intrusion rules are set.

Administrator credentials are not stored within browser cookies and administrative actions are not performed via a web browser.  As a result, browser-based HTML scripting attacks against administrators are unlikely to have a security impact (the vendor states that there is definitively no impact).  Based on this, we had originally decided to remove the alert from our database.  However, the author maintains that the behavior is described accurately.  So, we are investigating the matter to determine the exact security impact.]\n\nIt is reported that the CyberGuard HTTP proxy does not filter HTML code from user-supplied URLs when displaying error pages for URLs with invalid domains.

After that message, the vendor responded to deny the vulnerability (see the Message History for the vendor's message).  NSSI-Research Labs subsequently issued another message reasserting the original claim and providing vulnerability details.  In addition, a cross-site scripting flaw has been reported.\n\nIt is reported that the firewall is vulnerable to SYN flood attacks. A remote user can send 40 or more TCP SYN packets to cause the target host to stop responding and the host to eventually crash.  This attack is reportedly successful even if the target host operating system has been hardened.\n\nIf the firewall is set to block all services and protocols, a remote user can send 500 or more TCP SYN packets to cause the target host to stop responding and CPU utilization to reach 100%.\n\nAlso, a remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser.

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Symantec Enterprise Firewall (formerly the Raptor firewall) in the FTP Proxy.  A remote user can conduct an FTP bounce attack against a non-protected FTP server by using a protected FTP server located behind the Symantec Enterprise Firewall and accessible via the firewall's FTP proxy.\nThe FTP bounce attack is one that uses an FTP server as an intermediary and a proxy for conducting the attack.  The intermediary is forced to generate a connection to the target (victim) server in such a manner that the actual target FTP server interprets the packets as originating from the intermediary instead of from the remote user.  If the target FTP server trusts the intermediary, the remote user may be able to gain access to the target FTP server.\n\nAccording to the report, the Symantec Enterprise Firewall's FTP proxy rewrites the inbound FTP \"PORT\" command within an FTP connection and changes the IP address specified in the PORT command to be the remote user's IP instead of the victim's IP address.  The port number is also reportedly mapped to another ephemeral port.  Because of this remapping, the firewall-protected FTP server that the remote user is employing as an intermediary in the attack cannot detect the FTP bounce attack, as it only sees the valid IP address of the remote user and does not see the target hosts's IP address.\n\nHowever, when the firewall-protected FTP Server makes the resulting outbound connection to the mapped IP address and port, the firewall apparently rewrites the IP address and port in the packet to be the originally specified IP address and port of the victim host.\n\nThis behavior does not compromise the firewall-protected FTP server, but rather, lets it be unknowingly used in attacks of other FTP servers located outside of the firewall.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.\n\nThe author of the report has provided a summary with a good graphical drawing of the vulnerable configuration, available at:\n\nhttp://www.nta-monitor.com/news/raptor-set.htm",
    "Impact'": "A remote user can conduct FTP bounce attacks against various FTP servers located outside of the firewall by using a firewall-protected FTP server as an intermediary.  This reportedly works even if the firewall-protected FTP server does not permit FTP bounce attacks.",

The hotfix is reported to be an enhanced version of the FTPd module for the affected platforms that extends the protection currently provided by the firewall.  The module update is available at:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/techsupp\n\nA user has reported that version 7.0 for Windows NT is vulnerable.  The vendor makes no mention of this in the advisory, but notes that they are analyzing their product line to determine the extent of the vulnerability.\n\nAccording to Symantec, the following enhancements have been made to the FTPd module for Solaris:\n\n1)      By default, if the firewall detects a PORT request destined for an IP address other than the IP address of the FTP client, it will log the following warning:\n\n353 Warning: PORT command referenced a destination (x.x.x.x) that doesn't match control channel (y.y.y.y): possible Bounce attack? To enforce strict PORT checking please set ftpd.allow_address_mismatch=False in the Config.cf file.\n\nIf the firewall administrator decides that this is not a problem in their environment, they can disable this Warning message by setting the following Config.cf variable:\n\nftpd.suppress_address_mismatch_warning=True \n(default is False)\n\n2)      If the firewall administrator wishes to enforce strict PORT command checking and block any PORT requests that reference a different address than the original FTP client IP they can set the following Config.cf variable:\n\nftpd.allow_address_mismatch=False (default is True)\n\nBy enforcing strict PORT checking on the firewall, security administrators do not have to make sure that all of their FTP servers are patched or configured to \nblock the FTP Bounce Attack.",

    "Description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Symantec Enterprise Firewall (formerly the Raptor firewall) in the FTP Proxy.  A remote user can conduct an FTP bounce attack against a non-protected FTP server by using a protected FTP server located behind the Symantec Enterprise Firewall and accessible via the firewall's FTP proxy.\nThe FTP bounce attack is one that uses an FTP server as an intermediary and a proxy for conducting the attack.  The intermediary is forced to generate a connection to the target (victim) server in such a manner that the actual target FTP server interprets the packets as originating from the intermediary instead of from the remote user.  If the target FTP server trusts the intermediary, the remote user may be able to gain access to the target FTP server.\n\nAccording to the report, the Symantec Enterprise Firewall's FTP proxy rewrites the inbound FTP \"PORT\" command within an FTP connection and changes the IP address specified in the PORT command to be the remote user's IP instead of the victim's IP address.  The port number is also reportedly mapped to another ephemeral port.  Because of this remapping, the firewall-protected FTP server that the remote user is employing as an intermediary in the attack cannot detect the FTP bounce attack, as it only sees the valid IP address of the remote user and does not see the target hosts's IP address.\n\nHowever, when the firewall-protected FTP Server makes the resulting outbound connection to the mapped IP address and port, the firewall apparently rewrites the IP address and port in the packet to be the originally specified IP address and port of the victim host.\n\nThis behavior does not compromise the firewall-protected FTP server, but rather, lets it be unknowingly used in attacks of other FTP servers located outside of the firewall.\n\nThe vendor has reportedly been notified.\n\nThe author of the report has provided a summary with a good graphical drawing of the vulnerable configuration, available at:\n\nhttp://www.nta-monitor.com/news/raptor-set.htm",

    "Impact'": "A user of the FireWall-1 remote access software can avoid having to periodically re-authenticate to the firewall.",
    "Solution": "The vendor has reportedly provided the following response, confirming the vulnerability and providing some recommendations:\n\n\"WRT the issue at hand: generally speaking, yes, the re-authentication mechanism can be manipulated on the client side to reduce the need for re-entering credentials, overriding the management station settings.  To accomplish this several things must be in place:\n\n1 - the user must be an authorized user (i.e., has a SR username/authentication credentials)\n2 - the user must be using \"cacheable\" credentials, such as: pre-shared secret, OS password or FW-1 internal passwords\n3 - the user must be able to edit the userc.C file\n4 - the user must have some hostile intent or is very uneducated in security practices (like posting their credentials on their keyboard) or their machine has been compromised.\n\nSeveral mechanisms exist to mitigate the above:\n- As of NG, the userc.C file does not need to be writeable by non-adminstrator privileged users.  For bounded OSes like NT, 2000, and XP this solves the issue, unless the user has administrative privileges.\n- Using a one time (S/Key) or periodic-based authentication credential (SecurID)\n- The encrypt_db (available in 4.0, 4.1 and NG) feature allows FW-1 administrators to, in effect, hide the topology data within userc.C where these settings are located.  The encrypt_db property is NOT overridable by the client (i.e., even if they change the setting of obscure_db in userc.C they must delete/re-create the site to get in clear).  Clearly, this is a security-through-obscurity mechanism and is not perfect.\n- As of 4.1, one can force topology data to be updated automatically and frequently, forcing the user to modify these re-authentication settings in the userc.C after each update (these are override-able, but can be obscured as well).\n\nIn summary, although yes, in theory you can override the re-authentiction timer, it does require someone with authorized credentials (or a compromised machine with those credentials available).  And, there are ways to manage/mitigate this.\n\nWe will also look at steps to add some mechanisms to enforce this, but again, for platforms like WinCE, and 9X this is problematic due to the lack of a privileged (super)user mechanism inherent in these OSes.\"",

A remote user can bypass access controls and connect to arbitrary ports on servers located behind the firewall via the HTTP Proxy.\nA remote user can reportedly initiate a connection to an IP addresses and web port located behind the firewall.  A common rule to allow this is:  \n\n\"Any / WebServer / http->ressource\"\n\nThen, the remote user can apparenly apply the CONNECT method to connect to another server, different from the IP address originally specified in the connection.  The remote user can reportedly connect to any port on that server, except for port 80.\n\nFor example, a remote user can use \"telnet [webserver_address] 80\" to attempt to connect to a protected webserver.  The web server apparently does not need to actually exist, as long as a rule exists on the firewall to permit the type of connection.  At the HTTP proxy menu, the remote user can reportedly enter the following to connect to a different protected server that the user is not authorized to connect to:\n\nCONNECT [mail_server]:[arbitrary_port] / HTTP/1.0\n\nThis reportedly works if the rules are set to allow \"Any  Webserver http->ressource\" and the following conditions are met:\n\n1) The firewall module is allowed access (i.e. via policy/properties, specific rules or \"Any  (dst) (svc)...\" rules\n2) \"CONNECT\" is allowed.
