    "Description": "CERT reported that the University of Oulu (Finland) has discovered vulnerabilities in many vendor implementations of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version 1.\nThe Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG, http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/) reports that there are numerous vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 implementations from many different vendors. A remote user can reportedly cause denial of service attacks or gain elevated privileges on the system. The extent of the vulnerabilities depends on the specific vendor implementation.",
    "Impact'": "A remote user may be able to cause denial of service conditions or may be able to obtain elevated privileges on the system.",
    "Solution": "HP reports that the following version are *not* vulnerable:\n\nX.21.00 and higher, where X = L through P.\n\nFor customers with vulnerable versions (X.08.32 and lower, where X = A through K), HP has released the following workaround for the HP JetDirect firmware and is working on a firmware fix:\n\nChange the set-community-name and use theAccess Control List as described in \"HP Jetdirect Print Servers - Making HP Jetdirect Print Servers Secure on the Network\":\n\nhttp://www.hp.com/cposupport/networking/support_doc/bpj05999.html#P88_10129\n\nTo limit the vulnerability, HP has the following recommendations:\n\nSNMPv1 security relies on the set community name. It is important that a set-community-name be configured on the Jetdirect device and that it be kept secret.\n\nJetdirect Print Servers offer an Access Control List that can be used to specify which hosts can make SNMP configuration changes to Jetdirect Print Servers.\n\nThe steps above can help prevent exploitation of the vulnerability.  To eliminate the vulnerability before a fix is available SNMP can be disabled on the Jetdirect device.\n\nTo disable SNMP on a JetDirect print server, HP has provided the following directions:\n\n1. Update the firmware to the highest level as described in the Jetdirect Upgrade Instructions document:\n\nhttp://www.hp.com/cposupport/networking/support_doc/bpj06917.html\n\nNOTE:    Disabling SNMP may affect device discovery and port monitors that use SNMP to get status on the device.  Use this feature with care.\n\n2.  Telnet to the Jetdirect device (on the latest firmware) and type:\n\n      snmp-config: 0\n      quit\n\nThis will completely disable SNMP on the Jetdirect device.\n\nHP always recommends upgrading Jetdirect firmware for the latest bug fixes and security benefits.  The upgrade firmware and download utility are available free of charge:\n\nhttp://www.hp.com/cposupport/networking/support_doc/bpj06917.html\n\nThe following is a list of JetDirect Product Numbers that can be freely upgraded to X.08.32 or X.21.00 or higher firmware.
